A rare case of pure N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole nephrolithiasis associated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment of pulmonary nocardiosis,"Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole is a commonly used antibiotic for treatment of urinary tract infections, but also used to treat less common conditions such as pulmonary nocardiosis. N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole is the main active metabolite of Sulfamethoxazole. Pure stones of this compound are very rare with only a few cases documented in the literature. Here we present a case of a patient treated with long term trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy for pulmonary nocardiosis who developed pure N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole nephrolithiasis resulting in upper tract obstruction. This report provides an additional data point for this unique calculus etiology.",Shanholtzer A.,"sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim","obstruction, nocardiosis, pulmonary nocardiosis, calculus, urinary tract infections, nephrolithiasis",we present a case,ICSR,
Paliperidone-Associated Sialorrhea: A Case Report With Review of Current Literature,"PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic-associated sialorrhea is a problematic adverse effect with potentially negative consequences on quality of life and medication adherence. While clozapine is the antipsychotic that is most associated with sialorrhea, there have been published reports of other second-generation antipsychotics associated with sialorrhea, including aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. Although drooling is mentioned within the package insert for paliperidone, to date there have been minimal published reports in which paliperidone is implicated as the offending agent. METHODS/PROCEDURES: Here, we present a case of sialorrhea in a 56-year-old male with schizoaffective disorder who had a supratherapeutic paliperidone level after both oral and intramuscular paliperidone use. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Paliperidone was ultimately cross tapered to aripiprazole, and the patient was given atropine drops and benztropine with resolution of the sialorrhea. We provide a review of the literature regarding the other available reports of paliperidone-associated sialorrhea, possible mechanisms behind pathophysiology, as well as reports from the World Health Organization and Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting systems. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the potential for paliperidone and other nonclozapine second-generation antipsychotics to be associated with sialorrhea, especially given the increased frequency of their use for a variety of psychiatric disorders.",Burk B.G.,"atropine, aripiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, quetiapine","drooling, adverse event, schizoaffective disorder, sialorrhea, adverse effect, psychiatric disorders",56 year old male,ICSR,
Septic Shock Induced by Acute Pyelonephritis Resulting from Kidney Stones Treated by Double-J Ureteral Stents in a Pregnant Woman: A Case Report and Literature Review,"BACKGROUND Bacteriuria occurs in many pregnant women which may result in symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), including acute pyelonephritis (APN), which can lead to septic shock. However, there was no standard protocol of managing pregnant women with APN about the regimen, timing, length of antibiotic appliance as well as the indication of implanting double-J ureteral stents in those with kidney stones. CASE REPORT A 26-year-old pregnant woman (G1P0, 27 weeks plus 3 days) presented to our hospital on account of fever and pain in the flanks and was admitted on account of suspected UTI due to bacteriuria and elevated inflammatory markers. Elevated WBC count of 18.26×10⁹/L, PCT of 2.75, CRP of 198 mg/L, existence of kidney stones, renal and perirenal inflammation were observed. Cefoperazone sodium sulbactam sodium was given. The patient experienced septic shock on day 2 with a low blood pressure of 81/52 mmHg. Double-J ureteral stents were implanted due to upper urinary tract obstruction on day 3 with continuous use of meropenem based on urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity results. From day 7, the antibiotics were changed to cefoperazone-sulbactam. The patient's laboratory results (biochemistry, PCT, and CRP) all gradually went to normal, and she was discharged on day 15. CONCLUSIONS We learned that urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity examination were suggested after bacteriuria was observed in pregnant women to guide further treatment. Once APN was suspected, antibiotic therapy should be commenced and early-stage drainage by double-J ureteral stents could be considered if warranted in appropriate patients.",Zhang M.,meropenem,"low blood pressure, obstruction, acute pyelonephritis, uti, pyelonephritis, shock, urinary tract obstruction, fever, kidney stones, septic shock, urinary tract infection, bacteriuria",26 year old pregnant woman,ICSR,Drug Exposure During Pregnancy
COVID-19 Mortality and Therapeutics in Nebraska and Southwest Iowa during Early Pandemic,"Abstract: BACKGROUNDDifferent pharmacotherapeutics have been introduced, and then stopped or continued, for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the risks associated with mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Data was concurrently or retrospectively captured on COVID-19 hospitalized patients from 6 regional hospitals within the health system. Demographic details, the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection, concomitant disease status, as well as the therapeutic agents used for treating SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., antimicrobials, dexamethasone, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab, and remdesivir) were recorded. Discrete and continuous variables were analyzed using SPSS (ver. 27). Logistic regression identified variables significantly correlated with mortality. RESULTS: 471 patients (admitted from 1 March 2020 through 15 July 2020) were reviewed. Mean (±SD) age and body weight (kg) were 62.5 ± 17.7 years and 86.3 ± 27.1 kg, respectively. Patients were Caucasian (50%), Hispanic (34%), African-American (10%), or Asian (5%). Females accounted for 52% of patients. Therapeutic modalities used for COVID-19 illness included remdesivir (16%), dexamethasone (35%), convalescent plasma (17.8%), and tocilizumab (5.8%). The majority of patients returned home (62%) or were transferred to a skilled nursing facility (23%). The overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2 was 14%. Logistic regression identified variables significantly correlated with mortality. Intubation, receipt of dexamethasone, African-American or Asian ethnicity, and being a patient from a nursing home were significantly associated with mortality (x(2) = 86.36 (13) p < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infected hospitalized patients had significant mortality risk if they were intubated, received dexamethasone, were of African-American or Asian ethnicity, or occupied a nursing home bed prior to hospital admission.",Destache C.J.,dexamethasone,"convalescent, sars cov 2 infection, sars, covid 19, mortality, illness",a patient,ICSR,
Acute lung toxicity by nitrofurantoin,"Nitrofurantoin is a synthetic derivative of imidazolinedione, used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections. It acts by inhibiting bacterial DNA, RNA and cell wall protein synthesis. It is used prophylactically as a urinary anti-infective agent against most gram-positive organism and for long-term suppression of infections. Nitrofurantoin-associated pulmonary injuries occur in 1% of patients, presenting with dyspnoea and dry cough, and it can mimic interstitial lung disease. We present a case of an 81-year-old woman with shortness of breath and cough 3 days after initiation of nitrofurantoin. CT of the chest revealed bilateral pleural effusion and extensive pulmonary interstitial prominence, suggesting pulmonary fibrosis. According to the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale score of 6, it was determined that nitrofurantoin was the probable cause, and immediate cessation of the medication showed a marked clinical improvement and resolution after 10 days.",Milazzo E.,nitrofurantoin,"pleural effusion, cough, toxicity, dry cough, shortness of breath, pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosis, adverse drug reaction, interstitial lung disease, lung disease, bilateral pleural effusion, urinary tract infections, dyspnoea",81 year old woman,ICSR,
Infliximab in treatment of refractory multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children with severe cardiac dysfunction,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has emerged as one of the several challenges thrown by the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 pandemic. Although diagnostic criteria of MIS-C have now been established to raise the clinical suspicion for the condition, the Kawasaki disease (KD)-like phenotype of MIS-C presents with additional therapeutic dilemmas. The treatment guidance till date remains empirical with consideration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoids. However, treatment of cases refractory to the current conventional therapy with respect to biologics remains uncertain. We describe here, an 8-year-old boy with MIS-C (KD-like phenotype) with severe cardiac dysfunction refractory to IVIG and pulse methylprednisolone who responded to tumor necrosis factor-α inhibition using infliximab.",Shankar G.H.,methylprednisolone,"cardiac dysfunction, tumor, dysfunction, necrosis, tumor necrosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome",8 year old boy,ICSR,
Intravenous route for folate supplementation in a patient with celiac disease treated by pemetrexed-based chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer,"Introduction: Oral folic acid supplementation is essential for patients treated with pemetrexed, to prevent the risk of severe hematologic toxicity. In case of intestinal absorption disorder, no recommendations exist for intravenous folic acid supplementation. Case report: We describe a 74-year-old patient with multimetastatic non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma, receiving first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC5, pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. The patient presented neglected celiac disease, resulting in malabsorption syndrome with iron and folic acid deficiency. The question was how to administer folic acid supplementation during the pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. Management and outcomes: Intravenous injection of 200 mg levoleucovorin on day 1 of cycle 1 of pemetrexed-based chemotherapy was administered and well tolerated. During the second cycle, the levoleucovorin perfusion was not renewed by omission. The patient was hospitalized for 7 days because of febrile aplasia. Piperacillin–tazobactam was started, and then switched to amoxicillin–clavulanate plus ciprofloxacin. After this episode of post-chemotherapy febrile aplasia, it was decided to systematically supplement the patient with intravenous levoleucovorin, with blood folate concentration monitoring at each cycle. At 16 months after start of treatment, the patient was in complete remission, indicating that the immune-chemotherapy was effective, with no further febrile neutropenia. Discussion/conclusion: This case report highlights intravenous levoleucovorin supplementation as an alternative to oral folic acid if needed during pemetrexed–antifolate-based chemotherapy.",Beaurain M.,"folate, pemetrexed, folic acid, ciprofloxacin, levoleucovorin","lung cancer, malabsorption, toxicity, folic acid deficiency, lung adenocarcinoma, aplasia, neutropenia, celiac disease, adenocarcinoma, febrile aplasia, febrile neutropenia, malabsorption syndrome",74 year old patient,ICSR,
Acute choroidal involvement in lupus nephritis: A case report and review of literature,"BACKGROUND Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), characterized by the production of autoantibodies and widespread deposition of immune complexes, predominantly affects women of childbearing age. More than one-third of SLE patients present ocular manifestations. Choroidal disease is currently not completely understood, and its precise differentiation from central serous chorioretinopathy is rarely achieved. To date, no more than 60 patients with choroidal involvement have been reported. CASE SUMMARY A 37-year-old Chinese woman experienced decreased visual acuity bilaterally, accompanied by increasing periorbital swelling and severe conjunctival chemosis. Decreased breath sounds in both bases were detected via auscultation, as well as pitting edema in both ankles. SLE and lupus nephritis were diagnosed based on serositis, renal disorder, leukopenia and positive anti-Smith and anti-nuclear antibodies. Lupus choroidopathy was diagnosed based on ocular presentation and imaging. The patient was treated with systemic corticosteroids, spironolactone, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and intravenous immunoglobulin. After 4 wk of hospitalization, the patient was discharged. Indocyanine green angiography showed no leakage from choroidal vessels, and ocular coherence tomography detected low amounts of subretinal fluid right before discharge. The patient was prescribed oral methylprednisolone, HCQ, and MMF. Two months after the first visit, ophthalmological examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/20 bilaterally, and SLE disease activity was well controlled; her symptoms disappeared completely. CONCLUSION Here we presented a case of lupus choroidopathy, successfully treated with systemic corticosteroids, and discussed previously reported cases, focusing on differential diagnosis with a central serous chorioretinopathy.",Yao Y.,"mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, spironolactone","central serous chorioretinopathy, ocular manifestations, renal disorder, systemic lupus erythematosus, periorbital swelling, lupus erythematosus, decreased visual acuity, decreased breath sounds, edema, pitting edema, leukopenia, lupus nephritis, chorioretinopathy, chemosis, serositis, swelling, nephritis",37 year old chinese woman,ICSR,Drug Exposure During Pregnancy
Novel intense pulsed light-photodynamic therapy strategy in the treatment of facial actinic keratoses concomitant with rosacea,"Rosacea presents as transient or persistent erythema, papules, pustules, flushing, and telangiectasia on the middle of the face, which has some clinical similarity with actinic keratosis (AK). These two conditions can coexist in the same patient. Dermoscopy and reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) could be useful methods for diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Novel intense pulsed light-photodynamic therapy (IPL-PDT) may have better tolerance and curative effect than traditional red-light 5-Aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT). Herein, we present a case of facial AKs concomitant with rosacea where combination therapy of novel IPL-PDT and oral minocycline was effective in that AK lesions were eliminated and the patient's facial erythema and telangiectasia were significantly improved.",Shen S.,minocycline,"rosacea, actinic keratosis, pustules, keratosis, telangiectasia, papules, erythema",we present a case,ICSR,
Septic arthritis due to Nocardia brasiliensis and a review of nocardiosis as a cause of arthritis,"Bacteria of the genus Nocardia are implicated in several disease processes but are a rare cause of septic arthritis. Typically, the cause of Nocardia septic arthritis is dissemination from a pulmonary infection in an immunocompromised host. Herein we present a case of a 64-year-old male who had received a long course of prednisone for membranous nephropathy and developed a septic arthritis due to Nocardia brasiliensis. He was treated sequentially with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin-clavulanate, linezolid and amoxicillin-clavulanate, tigecycline and amoxicillin-clavulanate, and omadacycline and amoxicillin-clavulanate. To our knowledge, only two prior cases of Nocardia brasiliensis septic arthritis without antecedent trauma to the joint or local skin breakdown have been reported. A review of the literature identified 19 other cases of Nocardia septic arthritis. This case reinforces the need to consider Nocardia infection in the differential diagnosis in the immunocompromised patient with concurrent pulmonary infection and septic arthritis.",Chandramohan D.,"sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, linezolid, tigecycline, prednisone","infection in an immunocompromised host, nocardiosis, nephropathy, skin breakdown, membranous nephropathy, arthritis, septic arthritis, nocardia infection, trauma",64 year old male,ICSR,
Severe interstitial pneumonia caused by cetuximab: A case report and review of the literature,"Cetuximab is an IgG1 chimeric mAb against epidermal growth factor receptor, which can be used for chemotherapy failure or tolerance in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor expressed RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. We report on a patient who developed rapid-onset interstitial pneumonia while being treated with cetuximab plus XELOX (oxaliplatin, capecitabine) for metastatic colorectal cancer. A 75-year-old man patient was administered cetuximab plus XELOX regularly. After his cetuximab schedule was adjusted from 1 to 2 weeks, he rapidly developed interstitial pneumonia which led to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Our literature review indicated that, for patients with risk factors, a 2-week regimen of cetuximab might lead to interstitial pneumonia. Clinicians should closely monitor patients for adverse drug reactions to improve drug safety.",Zhou L.-Y.,capecitabine,"pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory distress, adverse drug reactions, metastatic, acute respiratory distress, acute respiratory distress syndrome, colorectal cancer, interstitial pneumonia",75 year old man patient,ICSR,
"Isotretinoin-Induced Delusional Disorder, Somatic Subtype","Isotretinoin, an active form of vitamin A, is the drug of last resort for the treatment of severe acne. Depression, suicidal ideation, and psychosis are among the most well-documented psychiatric side effects. Here, we report a case of isotretinoin-induced psychosis, which was diagnosed as delusional disorder somatic subtype, in a young male in the absence of any prodromal symptoms, previous psychiatric history, or family history of mental illness. The onset of psychosis was in the context of a dosage increase from 40 mg/day to 80 mg/day.

Unilateral Conjunctival in situ Squamous Carcinoma with Bilateral Conjunctival Chlorpromazine-Induced Secondary Melanosis Masquerading as in situ and Invasive Melanoma,"Purpose: To describe the clinical and histopathological features of a 61-year-old male with a history of eczema, asthma and schizophrenia on long-term chlorpromazine medication, who developed a unilateral limbal tumour in association with bilateral melanosis. Procedures: The patient was referred for a routine cataract assessment, and an incidental pink gelatinous limbal lesion was detected on the left side, associated with bilateral speckled brown conjunctival pigmentation. The limbal lesion and brown pigmentation were biopsied. The tissue was fixed in standard buffered formalin and processed to paraffin wax, and sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Tissue from the pigmented area was also processed for transmission electron microscopy. Results: The biopsy from the limbal lesion showed an in situ squamous carcinoma associated with prominent numbers of intra-epithelial eosinophils. The biopsy of the pigmented area showed bilateral melanosis without atypia. The latter was attributable to an increase in melanin production rather than to melanocyte hyperplasia. Melanophages were also present in the adjacent substantia propria. These pigment changes were entirely compatible with chlorpromazine-induced secondary melanosis. Conclusions: This paper highlights the first documented occurrence of in situ squamous carcinoma with bilateral chlorpromazine-induced conjunctival secondary melanosis. This clinically masqueraded as in situ melanoma/primary acquired melanosis and invasive melanoma. Bilateral melanosis is rare, has many causes and, in this case, was drug induced. This highlights the importance of thorough history taking and illustrates that not all pigmented and amelanotic lesions are in situ melanomas, primary acquired melanosis or invasive melanomas. Lastly, atopy was a risk factor for the development of this in situ squamous carcinoma.",Sears K.S.,chlorpromazine,"melanoma, melanosis, atopy, hyperplasia, asthma, tumour, pigmentation, cataract, eczema, drug induced, conjunctival pigmentation, schizophrenia",61 year old male,ICSR,
