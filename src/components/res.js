      <td>Green and controllable synthesis of kelp-like carbon nitride nanosheets via an ultrasound-mediated self-assembly strategy</td>
      <td>The application of graphite carbon nitride photocatalysts is hampered by their low specific surface areas, few active sites, and low photogenerated electron-hole transfer rates. Here, we report a green and controllable strategy for synthesizing kelp-like carbon nitride nanosheets through self-assembled materials prepared from melamine and trithiocyanuric acid using sonochemistry. The prepared carbon nitride nanosheets showed superior and long-lasting photocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution and the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride. The significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance of carbon nitride nanosheets is attributed to the curled porous nanosheet structure and the appropriate amount of O-doping. This work provides a new design strategy for preparing shape-controlled carbon nitride catalysts via a green, fast, sonochemically mediated self-assembly approach.</td>

      <td>Starch nanoparticles improve curcumin-induced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines in intestinal epithelial cells</td>
      <td>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a long-term condition resulting from self-sustained intestinal inflammation. Curcumin (Cur), a powerful, naturally occurring antioxidant and anti-inflammatory polyphenol, has been investigated as a therapeutic for IBD, but its poor stability and low bioavailability limits its efficacy. We investigated the use of crosslinked starch nanocarrier (NPL) on the intracellular delivery and the anti-inflammatory efficiency of curcumin. Caco-2 epithelial cells were stimulated with TNFα for 24 h and the anti-inflammatory effects of NPL/Cur formulations were evaluated at the early stages of inflammation (4 h) or later, when fully established (24 h). NPL allowed the intracellular delivery of curcumin, which was enhanced in inflammatory cells, due to a modification of the endocytosis pathways. NPL/Cur decreased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 while increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Finally, the inflammation-related opening of the tight junctions better allowed NPL/Cur to cross the epithelium by paracellular transport. This was confirmed by ex vivo analysis where NPL/Cur, administered to colonic explants from chemically-induced acute colitis mouse model, delivered curcumin deeper in the epithelium. To conclude, NPL/Cur formulation emphasizes the anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin and could constitute a therapeutic alternative in the management of IBD.</td>

      <td>Autophagy, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis in tumor immunotherapy</td>
      <td>In recent years, immunotherapy represented by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has led to unprecedented breakthroughs in cancer treatment. However, the fact that many tumors respond poorly or even not to ICIs, partly caused by the absence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), significantly limits the application of ICIs. Converting these immune “cold” tumors into “hot” tumors that may respond to ICIs is an unsolved question in cancer immunotherapy. Since it is a general characteristic of cancers to resist apoptosis, induction of non-apoptotic regulated cell death (RCD) is emerging as a new cancer treatment strategy. Recently, several studies have revealed the interaction between non-apoptotic RCD and antitumor immunity. Specifically, autophagy, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis exhibit synergistic antitumor immune responses while possibly exerting inhibitory effects on antitumor immune responses. Thus, targeted therapies (inducers or inhibitors) against autophagy, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis in combination with immunotherapy may exert potent antitumor activity, even in tumors resistant to ICIs. This review summarizes the multilevel relationship between antitumor immunity and non-apoptotic RCD, including autophagy, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis, and the potential targeting application of non-apoptotic RCD to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in malignancy.</td>

      <td>Acute Kidney Injury Possibly Due to the FLT3 Inhibitor Gilteritinib in a Patient with Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia: a Case Report</td>
      <td>The mutation of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is one of the most common driver mutations seen in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) The prognosis of patients with FLT3 mutation AML is poor. The FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib is now available for FLT3 mutation relapsed/refractory AML. The overall response to gilteritinib against FLT3 mutation relapsed/refractory AML is approx. 50%. The major side effects of gilteritinib are diarrhea, hepatic transaminase elevation, and cytopenia. Acute kidney injury is detected in less than one-fifth of the patients. All of the reported adverse events related to kidney injury are limited to grades 1 and 2, whereas grade 3 or worse adverse events of creatinine elevation are quite rare. Here, we provide the first report of a severe acute kidney injury that may be due to gilteritinib treatment in a patient for whom temporary hemodialysis was required. Our patient might have had renal dysfunction before the administration of gilteritinib due to previous treatments. It is important to recognize this rare but critical adverse effect, because gilteritinib is being used for previously extensively treated AML patients.</td>

      <td>Soil-derived bacteria endow Camellia weevil with more ability to resist plant chemical defense</td>
      <td>Background: Herbivorous insects acquire their gut microbiota from diverse sources, and these microorganisms play significant roles in insect hosts’ tolerance to plant secondary defensive compounds. Camellia weevil (Curculio chinensis) (CW) is an obligate seed parasite of Camellia oleifera plants. Our previous study linked the CW’s gut microbiome to the tolerance of the tea saponin (TS) in C. oleifera seeds. However, the source of these gut microbiomes, the key bacteria involved in TS tolerance, and the degradation functions of these bacteria remain unresolved. Results: Our study indicated that CW gut microbiome was more affected by the microbiome from soil than that from fruits. The soil-derived Acinetobacter served as the core bacterial genus, and Acinetobacter sp. was putatively regarded responsible for the saponin-degradation in CW guts. Subsequent experiments using fluorescently labeled cultures verified that the isolate Acinetobacter sp. AS23 can migrate into CW larval guts, and ultimately endow its host with the ability to degrade saponin, thereby allowing CW to subsist as a pest within plant fruits resisting to higher concentration of defensive chemical. Conclusions: The systematic studies of the sources of gut microorganisms, the screening of taxa involved in plant secondary metabolite degradation, and the investigation of bacteria responsible for CW toxicity mitigation provide clarified evidence that the intestinal microorganisms can mediate the tolerance of herbivorous insects against plant toxins.

      <td>Chemical composition, anticancer and antibacterial activity of Nepeta mahanensis essential oil</td>
      <td>Background: Conventional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, often affect the patients’ quality of life due to their serious side effects, indicating the urgent need to develop less toxic and more effective alternative treatments. Medicinal plants and their derivatives are invaluable sources for such remedies. The present study aimed to determine the chemical composition, anticancer and antibacterial activities of Nepeta mahanesis essential oil (EO). Methods: The chemical composition of EO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Cytotoxicity and apoptosis/necrosis induction of EO was analyzed by MTT assay and Flow cytometry. Real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the Bax/Bcl2 gene expression. Also, the effect of the EO on the cells’ mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ROS level was assessed. DPPH assay was done to assess the free radical scavenging activity of the EO. The Antimicrobial activity, MIC, and MBC of the oil were determined via well-diffusion and broth microdilution methods. Results: Based on the GC-MS analysis, 24 compounds were identified in the EO, of which 1,8-cineole (28.5%), Nepetalactone (18.8%), germacrene D (8.1%), and β-pinene (7.2%), were the major compounds. Also, the EO showed considerable cytotoxicity against MCF-7, Caco-2, SH-SY5Y, and HepG2 after 24 and 48 h treatment with IC(50) values between 0.0.47 to 0.81 mg/mL. It was revealed that this compound increased the Bax/Bcl2 ratio in the MCF-7 cells and induced apoptosis (27%) and necrosis (18%) in the cells. Moreover, the EO treatment led to a substantial decrease in MMP, which is indicative of apoptosis induction. A significant increase in ROS level was also detected in the cells following exposure to the EO. This compound showed strong DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC(50): 30). It was also effective against Gram-positive E. faecalis (ATCC 29,212) and Gram-negative E. coli (ATCC 11,333) bacteria. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrated that the EO of N. mahanesis could be considered a bioactive product with biomedical applications that can be used as an alternative cancer treatment and applied in the biomedical industries.</td>

      <td>Contribution of tetrodotoxin-resistant persistent Na(+) currents to the excitability of C-type dural afferent neurons in rats</td>
      <td>Background: Growing evidence supports the important role of persistent sodium currents (I(NaP)) in the neuronal excitability of various central neurons. However, the role of tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) Na(+) channel-mediated I(NaP) in the neuronal excitability of nociceptive neurons remains poorly understood. Methods: We investigated the functional role of TTX-R I(NaP) in the excitability of C-type nociceptive dural afferent neurons, which was identified using a fluorescent dye, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchloride (DiI), and a whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Results: TTX-R I(NaP) were found in most DiI-positive neurons, but their density was proportional to neuronal size. Although the voltage dependence of TTX-R Na(+) channels did not differ among DiI-positive neurons, the extent of the onset of slow inactivation, recovery from inactivation, and use-dependent inhibition of these channels was highly correlated with neuronal size and, to a great extent, the density of TTX-R I(NaP). In the presence of TTX, treatment with a specific I(NaP) inhibitor, riluzole, substantially decreased the number of action potentials generated by depolarizing current injection, suggesting that TTX-R I(NaP) are related to the excitability of dural afferent neurons. In animals treated chronically with inflammatory mediators, the density of TTX-R I(NaP) was significantly increased, and it was difficult to inactivate TTX-R Na(+) channels. Conclusions: TTX-R I(NaP) apparently contributes to the differential properties of TTX-R Na(+) channels and neuronal excitability. Consequently, the selective modulation of TTX-R I(NaP) could be, at least in part, a new approach for the treatment of migraine headaches.</td>

      <td>A convolutional neural network highlights mutations relevant to antimicrobial resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis</td>
      <td>Long diagnostic wait times hinder international efforts to address antibiotic resistance in M. tuberculosis. Pathogen whole genome sequencing, coupled with statistical and machine learning models, offers a promising solution. However, generalizability and clinical adoption have been limited by a lack of interpretability, especially in deep learning methods. Here, we present two deep convolutional neural networks that predict antibiotic resistance phenotypes of M. tuberculosis isolates: a multi-drug CNN (MD-CNN), that predicts resistance to 13 antibiotics based on 18 genomic loci, with AUCs 82.6-99.5% and higher sensitivity than state-of-the-art methods; and a set of 13 single-drug CNNs (SD-CNN) with AUCs 80.1-97.1% and higher specificity than the previous state-of-the-art. Using saliency methods to evaluate the contribution of input sequence features to the SD-CNN predictions, we identify 18 sites in the genome not previously associated with resistance. The CNN models permit functional variant discovery, biologically meaningful interpretation, and clinical applicability.</td>

      <td>Nanomicelles co-loaded with doxorubicin and salvianolic acid A for breast cancer chemotherapy</td>
      <td>Background: Multi-drug delivery system based on polymer carrier is emerging for alleviating dose-limiting toxicities of first-line cytotoxic anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin (DOX) for breast cancer chemotherapy. By co-loading the premium natural antioxidant salvianolic acid A (SAA) through colloidal self-assembly of amphiphilic copolymer, we herein developed CPMSD, a complex polymeric micellar system to overcome cardiotoxicity associated with DOX. Results: Optimal formulation was obtained by DOE study and CPMSD micelles were well constructed by using mPEG-PCL for entrapment at a drug–carrier mass ratio of 1:5 and DOX–SAA mass ratio of 1:4. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed the ratiometrical co-encapsulation of SAA into the hydrophobic cavity but DOX to ball-shaped surface of micelles due to hydrophilicity. Characterization study manifested favorable biopharmaceutical properties, such as small and uniform particle size, fairly high drug loading capacity, as well as good colloidal stability and controlled drug release. CPMSD maintained anticancer efficacy of DOX and the action mechanism, which did not be affected by co-administering SAA. More to the point, it was of great benefit to systemic safety and cardioprotective effect against oxidative stress injuries associated with DOX in tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions: All the findings substantiated that CPMSD would be a promising multifunctional nanosystem of DOX for breast cancer chemotherapy.</td>

      <td>Targeting autophagy increases the efficacy of proteasome inhibitor treatment in multiple myeloma by induction of apoptosis and activation of JNK</td>
      <td>Background: The therapeutic armamentarium in multiple myeloma has been significantly broadened by proteasome inhibitors, highly efficient means in controlling of multiple myeloma. Despite the developments of therapeutic regimen in treatment of multiple myeloma, still the complete remission requires a novel therapeutic strategy with significant difference in outcomes. Proteasome inhibitors induce autophagy and ER stress, both pivotal pathways for protein homeostasis. Recent studies showed that the IRE1α-XBP1 axis of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is up-regulated in multiple myeloma patients. In addition, XBP1 is crucial for the maintenance of viability of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Results: We analyzed the efficacy of targeting IRE1α-XBP1 axis and autophagy in combination with proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib in treatment of multiple myeloma. In this present study, we first show that targeting the IRE1α-XBP1 axis with small molecule inhibitors (STF-083010, A106) together with the ixazomib induces cell cycle arrest with an additive cytotoxic effect in multiple myeloma. Further, we examined the efficacy of autophagy inhibitors (bafilomycin A, BAF and chloroquine, CQ) together with ixazomib in multiple myeloma and observed that this combination treatment synergistically reduced cell viability in multiple myeloma cell lines (viable cells Ixa: 51.8 ± 3.3, Ixa + BAF: 18.3 ± 7.2, Ixa + CQ: 38.4 ± 3.7) and patient-derived multiple myeloma cells (Ixa: 59.6 ± 4.4, Ixa + CQ: 7.0 ± 2.1). We observed, however, that this combined strategy leads to activation of stress-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Cytotoxicity mediated by combined proteasome and autophagy inhibition was reversed by addition of the specific JNK inhibitor JNK-In-8 (viable cells: Ixa + BAF: 11.6 ± 7.0, Ixa + BAF + JNK-In-8: 30.9 ± 6.1). Conclusion: In this study we showed that combined inhibition of autophagy and the proteasome synergistically induces cell death in multiple myeloma. Hence, we consider the implication of pharmaceutical inhibition of autophagy together with proteasome inhibition and UPR-directed therapy as promising novel in vitro treatment strategy against multiple myeloma.</td>

      <td>Serum S100A8/A9 concentrations are associated with neuropsychiatric involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus: a cross-sectional study</td>
      <td>Background: Neuropsychiatric (NP) involvement and fatigue are major problems in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). S100A8/A9 is a marker of inflammation and responds to therapy in SLE patients. S100A8/A9 has an immunopathogenic role in various neurological diseases. We investigated S100A8/A9 in relation to NP-involvement and fatigue in SLE. Methods: 72 consecutive SLE outpatients at a tertiary centre and 26 healthy controls were included in this cross-sectional study. NPSLE was determined by specialists in rheumatology and neurology and defined according to three attribution models: “ACR”, “SLICC A” and “SLICC B”. Cerebral MRI was assessed by a neuroradiologist and neurocognitive testing by a neuropsychologist. The individuals were assessed by scores of pain (VAS), fatigue (VAS and FSS), and depression (MADRS-S). Concentrations of S100A8/A9 in serum and cerebrospinal fluid were measured with ELISA. Statistical calculations were performed using non-parametric methods. Results: Serum concentrations of S100A8/A9 were higher in SLE patients compared with controls (medians 1230 ng/ml; 790 ng/ml, p = 0.023). The concentrations were higher in NPSLE patients compared with non-NPSLE patients when applying the SLICC A and ACR models, but not significant when applying the SLICC B model (medians 1400 ng/ml; 920 ng/ml, p = 0.011; 1560 ng/ml; 1090 ng/ml, p = 0.050; 1460 ng/ml; 1090 ng/ml, p = 0.083, respectively). No differences of CSF S100A8/A9 concentrations were observed between NPSLE and non-NPSLE patients. SLE patients with depression or cognitive dysfunction as an ACR NPSLE manifestation had higher serum S100A8/A9 concentrations than non-NPSLE patients (median 1460 ng/ml, p = 0.007 and 1380 ng/ml, p = 0.013, respectively). Higher serum S100A8/A9 correlated with higher VAS fatigue (r = 0.31; p = 0.008) and VAS pain (r = 0.27, p = 0.021) in SLE patients. Serum S100A8/A9 was not independently associated with NPSLE when adjusting for scores of fatigue (FSS) and pain (VAS) (OR 1.86, 95% CI 0.93–3.73, p = 0.08). Conclusions: Serum S100A8/A9 concentrations may be associated with NPSLE and fatigue. S100A8/A9 may be of interest in evaluating NPSLE, although further investigations are needed.</td>

      <td>Genome characteristics of clinical Salmonella enterica population from a state public health laboratory, New Hampshire, USA, 2017–2020</td>
      <td>Background: The implementation of whole genome sequencing (WGS) by PulseNet, the molecular subtyping network for foodborne diseases, has transformed surveillance, outbreak detection, and public health laboratory practices in the United States. In 2017, the New Hampshire Public Health Laboratories, a member of PulseNet, commenced the use of WGS in tracking foodborne pathogens across the state. We present some of the initial results of New Hampshire’s initiative to transition to WGS in tracking Salmonella enterica, a bacterial pathogen that is responsible for non-typhoidal foodborne infections and enteric fever. We characterize the population structure and evolutionary history of 394 genomes of isolates recovered from human clinical cases in New Hampshire from 2017 to 2020. Results: The New Hampshire S. enterica population is phylogenetically diverse, consisting of 78 sequence types (ST) and 67 serotypes. Six lineages dominate the population: ST 11 serotype Enteritidis, ST 19 Typhimurium, ST 32 Infantis, ST 118 Newport, ST 22 Braenderup, and ST 26 Thompson. Each lineage is derived from long ancestral branches in the phylogeny, suggesting their extended presence in the region and recent clonal expansion. We detected 61 genes associated with resistance to 14 antimicrobial classes. Of these, unique genes of five antimicrobial classes (aminocoumarins, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, nitroimidazoles, and peptides) were detected in all genomes. Rather than a single clone carrying multiple resistance genes expanding in the state, we found multiple lineages carrying different combinations of independently acquired resistance determinants. We estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor of the predominant lineage ST 11 serotype Enteritidis (126 genomes) to be 1965 (95% highest posterior density intervals: 1927–1982). Its population size expanded until 1978, followed by a population decline until 1990. This lineage has been expanding since then. Comparison with genomes from other states reveal lack of geographical clustering indicative of long-distance dissemination. Conclusions: WGS studies of standing pathogen diversity provide critical insights into the population and evolutionary dynamics of lineages and antimicrobial resistance, which can be translated to effective public health action and decision-making. We highlight the need to strengthen efforts to implement WGS-based surveillance and genomic data analyses in state public health laboratories.</td>

Case study: The case in this report is associated with fungal petrositis. The clinical symptoms are: ear pain from chronic otitis media, severe headache, peripheral facial palsy and diplopia. The case was finally confirmed through imaging of middle ear, bacterial culture, pathology, and blood Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) test. The patient was treated with sensitive antifungal drugs. Conclusion: Drug treatment is conservative but efficient method in this case. mNGS can provide pathogenic reference, when antibiotic is not efficient enough for fungal infections or drug-resistant fungal infections cases. This allows we to adjust drug use for the treatment.</td>

Case presentation: A 55-year-old female was referred because of recurrent unilateral anterior hypopyon uveitis with partial response to topical corticosteroid. All of the laboratory tests, review of systems and ocular sampling results were unremarkable. Given a high concern for masquerades syndromes, cytological specimens were obtained 3 times and the last sample showed large B cell lymphoma. First, it appeared confined to the eye and initially responded favorably to local chemotherapy (methotrexate and rituximab) but later went on to develop systemic involvement. CNS lymphoma was detected on the third brain MRI 6 months following ocular involvement. At this time, systemic chemotherapy was started. In the last 18 months’ follow-up, visual acuity was 20/30 in the right eye without posterior segment or fellow eye involvement. Conclusion: Unusual presentation of intraocular lymphoma as a unilateral isolated anterior hypopyon uveitis should be kept in mind. This report emphasizes the importance of precise work-ups and multiple ocular biopsies to confirm the diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma.</td>

      <td>Spatiotemporal dynamics of malaria in Banmauk Township, Sagaing region of Northern Myanmar: characteristics, trends, and risk factors</td>
      <td>Background: While national malaria incidence has been declining in Myanmar, some subregions within the nation continue to have high burdens of malaria morbidity and mortality. This study assessed the malaria situation in one of these regions, Banmauk Township, located near the Myanmar-India border. Our goal was to provide a detailed description of the malaria epidemiology in this township and to provide some evidence-based recommendations to formulate a strategy for reaching the national malaria elimination plan. Banmauk consistently has one of the highest malaria burdens in Myanmar. Methods: With the implementation of strengthened malaria control and surveillance activities after the endorsement of a national malaria elimination plan in 2015, detailed incidence data were obtained for 2016–2018 for Banmauk Township. The data include patient demographics, parasite species, disease severity, and disease outcome. Data were analyzed to identify characteristics, trends, distribution, and risk factors. Results: During 2016–2018, 2,402 malaria cases were reported, with Plasmodium falciparum accounting for 83.4% of infections. Both P. falciparum and P. vivax were transmitted more frequently during the rainy season (May–October). Despite intensified control, the annual parasite incidence rate (API) in 2017 (11.0) almost doubled that in 2016 (6.5). In total, 2.5% (59/2042) of the cases, of which 54 P. falciparum and 5 P. vivax, were complicated cases, resulting in 5 deaths. Malaria morbidity was high in children &lt; 15 years and accounted for 33.4% of all cases and about 47% of the complicated cases. Older age groups and males living with poor transportation conditions were more likely to test positive especially in rainy and cold seasons. Despite the clear seasonality of malaria, severe cases were found among young children even more common in the dry season, when malaria incidence was low. Conclusions: Despite the declining trend, the malaria burden remained high in Banmauk Township. Our study also documented severe cases and deaths from both falciparum and vivax malaria. P. falciparum remained the predominant parasite species, demanding increased efforts to achieve the goal of elimination of P. falciparum by 2025. As P. falciparum cases decreased, the proportion of cases attributable to P. vivax increased.

      <td>A CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc, alleviates neural circuit dysfunction and behavioral disorders induced by prenatal valproate exposure</td>
      <td>Background: Valproic acid (VPA) is a clinically used antiepileptic drug, but it is associated with a significant risk of a low verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) score, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder in children when it is administered during pregnancy. Prenatal VPA exposure has been reported to affect neurogenesis and neuronal migration and differentiation. In addition, growing evidence has shown that microglia and brain immune cells are activated by VPA treatment. However, the role of VPA-activated microglia remains unclear. Methods: Pregnant female mice received sodium valproate on E11.5. A microglial activation inhibitor, minocycline or a CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc was dissolved in drinking water and administered to dams from P1 to P21. Measurement of microglial activity, evaluation of neural circuit function and expression analysis were performed on P10. Behavioral tests were performed in the order of open field test, Y-maze test, social affiliation test and marble burying test from the age of 6 weeks. Results: Prenatal exposure of mice to VPA induced microglial activation and neural circuit dysfunction in the CA1 region of the hippocampus during the early postnatal periods and post-developmental defects in working memory and social interaction and repetitive behaviors. Minocycline, a microglial activation inhibitor, clearly suppressed the above effects, suggesting that microglia elicit neural dysfunction and behavioral disorders. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that the expression of a chemokine, C–C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), was upregulated in the hippocampi of VPA-treated mice. CCL3 expression increased in microglia during the early postnatal periods via an epigenetic mechanism. The CCR5 antagonist maraviroc significantly suppressed neural circuit dysfunction and post-developmental behavioral disorders induced by prenatal VPA exposure. Conclusion: These findings suggest that microglial CCL3 might act during development to contribute to VPA-induced post-developmental behavioral abnormalities. CCR5-targeting compounds such as maraviroc might alleviate behavioral disorders when administered early.</td>

      <td>While socioeconomic disparities impact clinical care and patient outcomes, their impact on the anatomic and visual outcomes of retinal detachment in patients with viral retinitis is unstudied. This case series included 18 eyes in 18 patients from a single academic institution between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2018. Patient characteristics including age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance, immunosuppression, viral retinitis, retinal detachment, retinal detachment repair, visual and anatomic outcomes, missed appointments, and Area Deprivation Index [ADI] were collected. The low-ADI group, indicating less socioeconomic disadvantage, was comprised of twelve patients with national ADIs less than 38, and the high-ADI group of six patients with national ADIs greater than 38. High-ADI patients tended to be younger (average age 38.0 versus 51.3; P = 0.06), of female sex (P = 0.03), and had more missed appointments (median 11.0 vs 0; P = 0.002). A similar number of patients in both the high-ADI and low-ADI groups underwent pars plana vitrectomy alone or pars plana vitrectomy with scleral buckle. Visual acuity was similar in the high-ADI group than in the low-ADI group at baseline, but worse at the final follow-up visit (P = 0.004). Post-operative and final visit ocular hypotony were more common in the high-ADI group (P = 0.02). In our series, socioeconomic disadvantage negatively affects the visual outcomes in patients with viral retinitis associated-retinal detachments. These factors should be considered by ophthalmologists when treating these patients.</td>

      <td>Safety and effectiveness of delivering mass drug administration for helminths through the seasonal malaria chemoprevention platform among Senegalese children: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial</td>
      <td>Background: Malaria remains a major health problem, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where more than 90% of the disease and where nearly all deaths occur in children. Adding to this high burden is the co-existence of intestinal and genito-urinary helminth infections. Existing control programmes for these helminths are operating sub-optimally. Conversely, a malaria prevention programme, called seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), introduced in 2012 has achieved more than 75% treatment coverage and prevented 75–85% cases of uncomplicated and severe malaria in children. This encouraging development supports the need to explore strategies involving the integration of helminth control with successful platforms such as SMC. This would align worm and malaria control within the Sustainable Development Goals of ending the diseases of poverty and promoting health and well-being for those at risk. Methods: This study will have quantitative and qualitative components. The quantitative component will be a three-arm, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, interventional study of co-administration of SMC and anthelminthic drugs to pre-school and school-age children in Saraya district, southeast Senegal. Six hundred children aged 1–14 years will be randomly assigned to receive either SMC drugs only, SMC drugs and praziquantel or SMC drugs and albendazole and praziquantel at a ratio of 1:1:1. The primary outcome will be solicited and unsolicited adverse reactions to the study medications. The secondary outcomes will be the prevalence and intensity of Plasmodium-helminth co-infection and the prevalence of anaemia and mean haemoglobin concentration. The qualitative component of the study will include the conduct of structured interviews to assess the acceptability, feasibility, enablers and barriers to the combined use of anthelminthic and SMC drugs among randomly selected parents/caregivers of children enrolled in the study and health care workers responsible for the delivery of the combined services. Discussion: This study will provide evidence to boost the public health recommendations for combined malaria and helminth control. If successful, this project will reinforce the evidence that health care systems in developing countries can be comprehensive health management rather than focussed on vertical management of a single disease.

      <td>Extrapyramidal (EP) symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia are common side effects of most antipsychotics, and may associate with impaired performance in neurocognitive testing. We studied EP symptoms in first-episode psychosis (FEP; n = 113). Cognitive testing and EP symptoms (three items of the Simpson-Angus Scale) were assessed at baseline and follow-up (mean follow-up time 12 months). Mild EP symptoms were present at treatment onset in 40% of the participants. EP symptoms were related with lower performance in neurocognitive testing at baseline and at follow-up, especially among those with nonaffective psychotic disorder, and especially in tasks requiring speed of processing. No associations between EP symptoms and social cognition were detected. In linear regression models, when positive and negative symptom levels and chlorpromazine equivalents were accounted for, baseline EP symptoms were associated with worse baseline global neurocognition and visuomotor performance. Baseline EP symptoms also longitudinally predicted global, verbal, and visuomotor cognition. However, there were no cross-sectional associations between EP symptoms and cognitive performance at follow-up. In sum, we found both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between EP symptoms and neurocognitive task performance in the early course of psychosis. Those without EP symptoms at the start of treatment had higher baseline and follow-up neurocognitive performance. Even mild EP symptoms may represent early markers of long-term neurocognitive impairment.</td>

      <td>The frequency of efflux pump genes expression in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from pulmonary secretions</td>
      <td>Acinetobacter baumannii is an important opportunistic pathogen, and the cause of nosocomial infections worldwide in recent decades. Efflux pumps are considered as the important causes of multidrug resistance of A. baumannii. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of efflux pump genes, and evaluate the antibiotic effect of Tigecycline on the expression of adeB gene in isolates of multidrug-resistant. A. baumannii. 70 isolates of A. baumannii were collected and confirmed by biochemical and molecular tests. Antibiotic resistance (Ciprofloxacin, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Tigecycline) was performed based on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. Then, the effect of Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone inhibitor (CCCP) on isolates was investigated and the frequency of adeB, adeG, adeJ and abeM genes were examined by PCR for isolates with reduced in MIC titer. Also, the antibiotic effect of Tigecycline on adeB gene expression in A. baumannii isolates was analyzed by Real-Time PCR. The antibiotic resistance for Ciprofloxacin, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Tigecycline was 97.1%, 95.8% and 37.2%, respectively. Following CCCP inhibitor use, the MIC titer had a decrease in MIC titer containing CCCP inhibitor was 64.3% for Ciprofloxacin, 51.5% for Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 50% for Tigecycline. The frequencies of genes associated with adeB, adeG, adeJ and abeM efflux pump were 100%, 92.8%, 86% and 98.5%, respectively. Real-Time PCR results showed a correlation between the antibiotic effects of Tigecycline on adeB gene expression. The antibiotic resistance of the isolates was relatively high. The isolates were resistant to Ciprofloxacin and Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole antibiotics, while more sensitive to Tigecycline. Also, efflux pump genes, which are the antibiotic resistance factors of A. baumannii, are frequently high in the isolates but it seems that isolates use other effluxe pumps than RND family to exit tigecycline.

      <td>Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is considered one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide and the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB can affect people of all age groups, including children (aged 0–15 years). However, very little is known about the extent of this problem in children. This systematic review aims to investigate the incidence of TB and drug-resistant (DR) TB among the pediatric population. It also reviews the therapeutic options available to treat the condition. Methods: A comprehensive search for all relevant evidence was conducted. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science. The searched time frame was limited from January 1990 to December 2020 with a focus on the incidence of TB and MDR-TB among pediatrics and the therapeutic options available. Results: A total of 537 articles were obtained via the selected databases. After title and abstract screening, 418 articles were excluded leaving 119 articles. Full-text screening was conducted on 119 articles, excluding a further 110 articles. Thus, 9 articles were subject to quality assessment and included in this review. The 9 articles represented the age group of 0–15 years and included both males and females. All studies included were of retrospective study design. Discussion: The included studies mentioned a moderate increase in TB cases among pediatrics exacerbated by malnutrition, lack of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. MDR-TB prevalence was especially high in South Africa. Drug therapy for both TB and MDR-TB yielded favorable outcomes among pediatrics. However, one of the biggest challenges with drug therapy includes the dosage forms available. Systematic review registration: DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/G34NF.</td>

      <td>Background: Post-injection paralysis (PIP) of the sciatic nerve is an iatrogenic paralysis that occurs after an intramuscular injection, with resultant foot deformity and disability. This study investigates the epidemiology and treatment of PIP in Uganda. Methods: Health records of pediatric patients surgically treated for PIP at the CoRSU Rehabilitation Hospital from 2013 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Pre-operative demographics, perioperative management, and outcomes were coded and analyzed with descriptive statistics, chi-square for categorical variables, and linear models for continuous variables. Results: Four-hundred and two pediatric patients underwent 491 total procedures. Eighty-three percent of reported injection indications were for febrile illness. Twenty-five percent of reported injections explicitly identified quinine as the agent. Although ten different procedures were performed, achilles tendon lengthening, triple arthrodesis, tibialis posterior and anterior tendon transfers composed 83% of all conducted surgeries. Amongst five different foot deformities, equinus and varus were most likely to undergo soft tissue and bony procedures, respectively (p=0.0223). Ninteen percent of patients received two or more surgeries. Sixty-seven percent of patients achieved a plantigrade outcome; 13.61% had not by the end of the study period; 19.3% had unreported outcomes. Those who lived further from the facility had longer times between the inciting injection and initial hospital presentation (p=0.0216) and were more likely to be lost to follow-up (p=0.0042). Conclusion: PIP is a serious iatrogenic disability. Prevention strategies are imperative, as over 400 children required 491 total surgical procedures within just six years at one hospital in Uganda.</td>

      <td>Background: The most appropriate alternative to induction therapy for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis (CM) remains unclear when standard treatment is unavailable, inaccessible, intolerable, or ineffective. Methods: A prospective, multi-centre cohort study was conducted to analyze the data of 156 HIV-infected patients with CM who were treated with amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmB-D) + flucytosine (5FC), voriconazole (VCZ) + 5FC, or AmB-D + Fluconazole (Flu) as induction regimens. Clinical efficacy, cumulative mortality, and adverse effects were compared among the three treatment groups. Results: Fewer deaths occurred by week 4 and week 10 among patients receiving AmB-D + 5FC than among those receiving AmB-D + Flu [4 (5.1%) vs. 8 (16.0%) deaths by week 4; hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 3.3; p = 0.039; and 8 (10.3%) vs. 14 (28.0%) deaths by week 10; hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.7; p = 0.008, respectively]. AmB-D plus 5FC was found to result in significantly higher rates of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture sterility (57.6% vs. 34% by week 2; 87.9% vs. 70% by week 10; p &lt; 0.05 for both comparisons). However, the differences in CSF culture sterility and mortality between the VCZ + 5FC group and the AmB-D + 5FC group were not statistically significant. VCZ plus 5FC had a significantly advantageous effect on the incidence of new AIDS-defining illness and length of hospital stay, compared with AmB-D plus 5FC. Laboratory adverse events (grade 3 or 4), such as severe anemia, were less frequent with VCZ + 5FC use than with AmB-D combined with 5FC or Flu use. Conclusion: Our results suggest that AmB-D combined with 5FC remains the more efficacious induction regimen compared to AmB-D plus Flu, and that VCZ + 5FC might be a potential alternative when the standard regimen is not readily available, accessible, tolerated, or effective.

      <td>Employer-sponsored health insurance and labor market outcomes for men in same-sex couples: Evidence from the advent of pre-exposure prophylaxis</td>
      <td>In the United States, the cost of providing employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) varies for employers based on the medical expenditures of their employees, a practice known as “experience rating”. Experience rating increases the cost of employing workers who have greater medical expenditures, one example being men in same-sex couples. To study whether ESI affects labor market outcomes for men in same-sex couples, I use the 2012 advent of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a $24,000 per year drug that effectively prevents Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) acquisition. Using American Community Survey data and a difference-in-difference empirical approach – comparing post-PrEP changes in earnings among men who have ESI – I find that annual earnings for men in same-sex couples decline by $2,650 (approximately 3.9%) relative to comparable men after PrEP becomes available. For those who are most likely to be taking Truvada (the brand name for PrEP), such as young men and white men, effects on earnings are considerably larger. I also observe a 3.7 percentage point (4.6%) decline in ESI prevalence and a 0.8 percentage point (10.7%) increase in part-time employment among men in same-sex couples. Event studies provide support for a causal interpretation for my findings. My estimates are also robust to placebo analyses, various specification permutations, and a range of sensitivity checks.</td>

      <td>Better together? Treating traumatic brain injury with minocycline plus N-acetylcysteine</td>
      <td>Traumatic brain injury has a complex pathophysiology that produces both rapid and delayed brain damage. Rapid damage initiates immediately after injury. Treatment of traumatic brain injury is typically delayed many hours, thus only delayed damage can be targeted with drugs. Delayed traumatic brain injury includes neuroinflammation, oxidative damage, apoptosis, and glutamate toxicity. Both the speed and complexity of traumatic brain injury pathophysiology present large obstacles to drug development. Repurposing of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs may be a highly efficient approach to get therapeutics to the clinic. This review examines the preclinical outcomes of minocycline and N-acetylcysteine as individual drugs and compares them to the minocycline plus N-acetylcysteine combination. Both minocycline and N-acetylcysteine are Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs with pleiotropic therapeutic effects. As individual drugs, minocycline and N-acetylcysteine are well tolerated, with known pharmacokinetics, and enter the brain through an intact blood-brain barrier. At concentrations greater than needed for anti-microbial action, minocycline is a potent anti-inflammatory minocycline, also acts as an antioxidant and inhibits multiple enzymes that promote brain injury including metalloproteases, caspases, and polyADP-ribose-polymerase-1. N-acetylcysteine alone is also an antioxidant. It increases brain glutathione, prevents lipid oxidation, and protects mitochondria. N-acetylcysteine also acts as an anti-inflammatory as well as increases extracellular glutamate by activating the X c cystine-glutamate anti-transporter. These multiple actions of minocycline and N-acetylcysteine have made them attractive candidates to treat traumatic brain injury. When first dosed within the one hour after injury, either minocycline or N-acetylcysteine improves a diverse set of therapeutic outcome measures in multiple traumatic brain injury animal models. A small number of clinical trials for traumatic brain injury have established the safety of minocycline or N-acetylcysteine and suggested that either drug has some efficacy. Preclinical studies have shown that minocycline plus N-acetylcysteine have positive synergy resulting in therapeutic effects and a more prolonged therapeutic time window not seen with the individual drugs. This review compares the actions of minocycline and N-acetylcysteine, individually and in combination. Evidence supports that the combination has greater utility to treat traumatic brain injury than the individual drugs.</td>

      <td>Unfolded p53 in non-neuronal cells supports bacterial etiology of Alzheimer's disease</td>
      <td>Alzheimer's disease has proven to be largely intractable to treatment, despite years of research, and numerous trials of therapies that target the hallmarks of the disease - amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The etiology of Alzheimer's disease remains elusive. There is a growing body of evidence for an infectious trigger of Alzheimer's disease, and, in particular, the focus has been on the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis). Reports of the expression of a misfolded form of p53 in non-neuronal cells (fibroblasts, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and B cells) and serum, which appears several years before clinical symptoms manifest, may provide further support for the role of bacteria in general, and P. gingivalis in particular, in the initiation of the disease. This review presents a model of the pathway from initial oral infection with P. gingivalis to amyloid plaque formation and neuronal degeneration, via the steps of chronic periodontitis; secretion of the inflammagens lipopolysaccharide and gingipains into the bloodstream; induction of an inflammatory response in both peripheral cells and tissues; disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and entry into the central nervous system of the inflammagens and the P. gingivalis bacteria themselves. In this model, the misfolded p53 (or 'unfolded p53'; up53) is induced in non-neuronal cells and upregulated in serum as a result of oxidative stress due to lipopolysaccharide from P. gingivalis. up53 is therefore a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of the presence of a causative agent of Alzheimer's disease. Fastidious dental hygiene and aggressive antibiotic treatment may prevent the patient progressing to clinical Alzheimer's disease if serum up53 is detected at this pre-symptomatic stage.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: Mycobacterium paragordonae (MPG) is an emerging and less common type of Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and we know little about its characteristics and prognosis, hence we constructed this retrospective cohort study. METHODS: MPG was identified using MALD-TOF MS, multi-target combined gene sequencing and WGS. Clinical information was collected, antimicrobial susceptibility testing was measured using the SLOMYCO panel, and optimal growth temperature testing was measured using Lowenstein-Jensen medium. RESULTS: Eight MPGs were isolated from 1730 NTMs (0.46%); the mean age of MPG pulmonary disease (MPG-PD) patients was 42.38 ± 9.92 years, 37.5% were male, and the average BMI was 18.4 ± 0.51 kg/m2. All patients had the symptoms of cough and sputum and CT images mainly presented in patchy or streaky shadows, MPG grew at 25°C, 30°C and 37°C, and the optimal growth temperature is 37°C. MPGs were sensitive to clarithromycin, rifabutin, amikacin, linezolid, moxifloxacin, cotrimoxazole and ciprofloxacin, two isolates were resistant to rifampicin. Two patients had follow up information, their imaging remained stable during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MPG-PD is a rare NTM disease and is more likely to develop in middle-aged, female, and low BMI patients. The patients present with no specific features within the symptoms as well as the CT imaging. The optimal growth temperature of MPG is at 37°C, MPG-PD has excellent sensitivity to drugs recommended by CLSI and presents with a stable disease.</td>

      <td>Water commuting is a major urban transportation method in Thailand. However, urban boat commuters risk exposure to microbially contaminated bioaerosols or splash. We aimed to investigate the microbial community structures, identify bacterial and viral pathogens, and assess the abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) at 10 sampling sites along an 18 km transportation boat route in the Saen Saep Canal, which traverses cultural, commercial, and suburban land-based zones. The shotgun metagenomic (Illumina HiSeq) and 16S rRNA gene amplicon (V4 region) (Illumina MiSeq) sequencing platforms revealed diverse microbial clusters aligned with the zones, with explicit segregation between the cultural and suburban sites. The shotgun metagenomic sequencing further identified bacterial and viral pathogens, and ARGs. The predominant bacterial pathogens (&gt;0.5 % relative abundance) were the Burkholderia cepacia complex, Arcobacter butzleri, Burkholderia vietnamiensis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the Enterobacter cloacae complex. The viruses (0.28 %–0.67 % abundance in all microbial sequences) comprised mainly vertebrate viruses and bacteriophages, with encephalomyocarditis virus (33.3 %–58.2 % abundance in viral sequences), hepatitis C virus genotype 1, human alphaherpesvirus 1, and human betaherpesvirus 6A among the human viral pathogens. The 15 ARG types contained 611 ARG subtypes, including those resistant to beta-lactam, which was the most diverse and abundant group (206 subtypes; 17.0 %–27.5 %), aminoglycoside (94 subtypes; 9.6 %–15.3 %), tetracycline (80 subtypes; 15.6 %–20.2 %), and macrolide (79 subtypes; 14.5 %–32.1 %). Interestingly, the abundance of ARGs associated with resistance to beta-lactam, trimethoprim, and sulphonamide, as well as A. butzleri and crAssphage, at the cultural sites was significantly different from the other sites (p &lt; 0.05). We demonstrated the benefits of using NGS to deliver insights into microbial communities, and antimicrobial resistance, both of which pose a risk to human health. Using NGS may facilitate microbial risk mitigation and management for urban water commuters and proximal residents.</td>

The presence of enterococci- and pseudomonad-specific taxon markers and of sul1 and ampC ARGs in the MBR effluent was confirmed, indicating the challenge of such processes, for the removal of biological molecules. On the other hand, &gt;99 % reduction of all types of cultivable bacteria examined was observed after MBR treatment, with a 5-log reduction of E. coli and 6-log reduction of P. aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. There was a shift in the bacterial community structure in the MBR effluent after the bench- and pilot-scale solar photo-Fenton oxidation. Notably, thermotolerant bacterial genera like Ignavibacterium and Thermomonas were prevalent during the pilot-scale process operated at a high ambient temperature, while the most prevalent genera were Mycobacterium, Nocardioides and Mesorhizobium, which are primarily not pathogenic and plant-related. In agreement, a different bacterial community structure according to the G-C content after DGGE analysis was noted between the MBR and solar photo-Fenton oxidation-treated effluents, but interestingly also between the bench- and pilot-scale oxidation-treated effluents. There was complete absence of ARGs after the bench-scale solar photo-Fenton oxidation application but not after the pilot-scale treatment (1.56 and 1.53 log(10) CE 100 ng(−1) DNA, of sul and ermB, respectively). Taxon-specific markers were found in both oxidation setups. Inactivation of cultivable Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. (including ARB) was achieved during both oxidation setups, with no further re-activation observed.</td>

      <td>An exhaustive investigation on antibiotics contamination from livestock farms within sensitive reservoir water area: Spatial density, source apportionment and risk assessment</td>
      <td>Although the studies on antibiotic contamination are common at present, large-scale sampling studies drawing highly representative conclusions are still scarce. This study conducted a comprehensive investigation on a total of 1183 samples from 70 livestock farms within a sensitive area around reservoir waters. 45 types of antibiotics belonging to 5 different classes were monitored. This is the first analysis to comprehensively investigate the density distribution, source apportionment, ecological and health risk of antibiotics in an entire area of sensitive waters. The results showed that the layer manure samples had highest detection rate of antibiotics (0.0 %–96.1 %, average value = 30.7 %) followed by pig manure samples. Oxytetracycline had the highest concentration of 712.16 mg/kg in a pig manure sample. Different from using antibiotic concentration as a proxy for pollution level, the spatial density was calculated by averaging antibiotic concentration to area and converting different livestock to pig equivalent. The spatial density of pig equivalent can more realistically reflect the pollution caused by different breeds of livestocks. It was shown that the pig farms contributed higher to total antibiotic density than the layer and cattle farms did. After assessed, a few antibiotics (oxytetracycline, chlorotetracycline and tetracycline) have posed high ecological risks to soil around the farms. However, none of them caused hazard quotient (HQ) risk and carcinogenic risk (CR) to human health in the water of reservoir. Children were more likely to be at hazard risk than adults. Antibiotic mass fluctuation rules were analyzed along the chain (feed → livestock waste → soil → surface water). Feed, livestock waste and soil had similar diversity, but the antibiotic concentrations continued to decline, implying the possible sources of antibiotic residues were similar. Thus, it is important to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use to prevent the potential long-term risk of antibiotics.</td>

      <td>The study of the presence of antibiotics in the aquatic environment is a preliminary step to analyse their possible harmful effects on aquatic ecosystems. In order to monitor their occurrence in the aquatic environment, the European Commission established in 2015, 2018, and 2020 three Watch Lists of substances for Union-wide monitoring (Decisions (EU) 2015/495, 2018/840, and 2020/1161), where some antibiotics within the classes of macrolides, fluoroquinolones and penicillins were included. In the Basque coast, northern Spain, three macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin) and ciprofloxacin were monitored quarterly from 2017 to 2020 (covering a period before and after the COVID19 outbreak), in water samples collected from two Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs), and three control points associated with receiving waters (transitional and coastal water bodies). This work was undertaken for the Basque Water Agency (URA). The three macrolide antibiotics in water showed a frequency of quantification &gt;65 % in the Basque coast, with higher concentrations in the WWTP emission stations than in receiving waters. Their frequency of quantification decreased from 2017 to 2020, as did the consumption of antibiotics in Spanish primary care since 2015. Ciprofloxacin showed higher frequencies of quantification in receiving waters than in wastewaters, but the highest concentrations were observed in the WWTP emission stations. Although consumption of fluoroquinolones (among which is ciprofloxacin) in primary care in the Basque Country has decreased in recent years, this trend was not observed in the waters sampled in the present study. On the other hand, concentrations of clarithromycin, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin in receiving waters exceeded their respective Predicted No-Effect Concentrations, so they could pose an environmental risk. These substances are widely used in human and animal medicine, so, although only ciprofloxacin is included in the third Watch List, it would be advisable to continue monitoring macrolides in the Basque coast as well.</td>

      <td>Background and Aims: Recurrent liver/biliary sepsis are rare and can occur in different situations. Curative treatment of acute septic episodes is based on antibiotics. Nevertheless, recurrent sepsis can be life-threatening, and the treatment of the underlying disease could be complex, and eventually not possible. The aim of the present study was to report our experience on prophylactic sequential antibiotic therapy for recurrent liver/biliary sepsis in a large cohort of patients with long follow-up. Methods: All patients who received a prophylactic sequential antibiotic therapy for recurrent liver/biliary sepsis in our institution from 2005 to 2020 were included. Prophylactic sequential antibiotic therapy was based on per os antibiotics with expected antibacterial activity on digestive bacteria, mainly Gram-negative bacilli. The primary end-point was the reduction of the number of septic episodes to 1 or less episode per year, and not severe (not requiring hospitalization). Results: Were included 33 adult patients and the main initial disease/condition leading to prophylaxis was history of hepaticojejunostomy (78.8%). The majority of septic episodes required hospitalization (57.6%). First line prophylactic sequential antibiotic therapy was weekly ciprofloxacin in all cases. First line therapy was successful in the long-term in 19 patients (57.6%), with a median follow-up of 92 months (range: 25-206). Global efficacy (first-second-third lines) was 28/33 (84.8%). Conclusions: The results of the present study with very long follow-up suggest that prophylactic sequential antibiotic therapy can successfully prevent recurrent liver/biliary sepsis with good tolerance.</td>

      <td>Genomic characterization of multidrug-resistant Salmonella Heidelberg E2 strain isolated from chicken carcass in southern Brazil</td>
      <td>Salmonella Heidelberg is a clinically-important serovar linked to food-borne illness, and commonly isolated from poultry products. Since 1962, Salmonella Heidelberg has been widely reported from poultry production systems in several countries, including Brazil. The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella Heidelberg strains in food animals underscores a significant food safety hazard. In our study, we performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) and Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, pathogenicity mechanisms and virulence factors (VF) in Salmonella Heidelberg E2 strain recovered from a chicken carcass in Southern Brazil. Salmonella Heidelberg strain belonged to ST15 and showed to be susceptible to colistin (MIC ≤2 μg/mL) and multidrug-resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefazolin, ceftiofur, nalidixic acid, azithromycin, erythromycin, doxycycline, tetracycline and sulfonamide. We identified AMR genes mediating resistance to aminoglycosides (aac(6′)-Iaa, aac(3)-VIa, aph(3′)-Ia, aadA, 16S rrsD), β-lactams (blaCTX-M-2), quinolones (parC), macrolides (acrB), tetracyclines (tet(A)), fosfomycin (fosA7) and sulfonamide (sul1). Interestingly, the mutation in parC T255S has never been reported among Salmonella Heidelberg strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a Salmonella enterica strain harbouring 16S rrsD 471G &gt; A, acrB F28L and acrB L40P chromosomal point mutations. Three plasmid replicon types, ST2-IncHI2, ST2-IncHI2A and IncX1 were identified. Nine Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands and 98 virulence genes encoding virulence factors were identified associated with cell adhesion, invasion, intracellular survival and resistance to antimicrobial peptides. Although Salmonella Heidelberg E2 strain likely originated from poultry, cross-contamination during meat processing cannot be excluded. This study adds to our understanding of Salmonella Heidelberg transmission along the food-chain and informs ongoing regulatory discussions on Salmonella Heidelberg in poultry.</td>

      <td>Misuse or overuse of antibiotics can have a variety of detrimental microbial effects. However, the body burden of antibiotics in the general population is currently unclear. In this cross-sectional study, we determined four classes of widely-applied antibiotics (3 imidazoles, 2 sulfonamides, 5 quinolones, and 2 chloramphenicols) in urine samples from 1170 adult residents in Shenzhen, China. Antibiotics were detected in 30.8 % of all urine samples with concentrations ranging from &lt;LOD to 3517 μg/mL, among which metronidazole, ofloxacin and florfenicol were predominant. Notably, antibiotics prohibited for human or veterinary use were detected in 21.0 % of samples, indicating that these antibiotics may still be overused in daily life. We found that the presence of antibiotics in urine is associated with being overweight (OR: 1.386, 95 % CI: 1.056–1.819, p = 0.019) and obesity (OR: 1.862, 95 % CI: 1.103–3.146, p = 0.020) in the adult population. Multilinear regression analysis showed that a percent increase of hydroxy metronidazole was related to 9.86 % positive change of body mass index (p = 0.029). Interestingly, we also found total antibiotic concentration higher in the unmarried group (p = 0.006). Besides, consumption of smoked foods was correlated with urinary antibiotic levels (p = 0.001), indicating smoked meat may be a potential exposure source of veterinary antibiotics. These results highlight the need to reduce human exposure to banned antibiotics. Future research could focus on assessing the health risk and other outcomes of antibiotic overuse.</td>

      <td>Global groundwater vulnerability for Pharmaceutical and Personal care products (PPCPs): The scenario of second decade of 21st century</td>
      <td>The global production of PPCPs have increased by multiple folds promoting excessive exposure of its metabolites to humans via different aquatic systems. The higher residence time of toxic precursors of these metabolites pose direct human health risk. Among the different aquatic systems, the contamination of groundwater by PPCPs is the most concerning threat. This threat is especially critical considering the lesser oxidizing potential of the groundwater as compared to freshwater/river water. A major challenge also arises due to excessive dependency of the world's population on groundwater, which is exponentially increasing with time. This makes the identification and characterization of spatial contamination hotspots highly probabilistic as compared to other freshwater systems. The situation is more vulnerable in developing countries where there is a reported inadequacy of wastewater treatment facilities, thereby forcing the groundwater to behave as the only available sequestrating sink for all these contaminants. With increased consumption of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals compounds, these wastes have proven capability in terms of enhancing the resistance among the biotic community of the soil systems, which ultimately can become catastrophic and carcinogenic in near future. Recent studies are supporting the aforementioned concern where compounds like diclofenac (analgesic) have attained a concentration of 1.3 mgL(−1) in the aquifer systems of Delhi, India. The situation is far worse for developed nations where prolonged and indiscriminate usage of antidepressants and antibiotics have life threating consequences. It has been confirmed that certain compounds like ofloxacin (antibiotics) and bis-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate are present in some of the most sensitive wells/springs of the United States and Mexico. The current trend of the situation has been demonstrated by integrating a comparative approach of the published literatures in last three years. This review provides first-hand information report for formulating a directive policy framework for tackling PPCPs issues in the groundwater system.</td>

      <td>Human RSV is the leading cause of infantile bronchiolitis in the world and one of the major causes of childhood deaths in resource-poor settings. It is a major unmet target for vaccines and anti-viral drugs. Respiratory syncytial virus has evolved a unique strategy to evade host immune response by coding for two non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2. Recently it was shown that in infected cells, nuclear NS1 could be involved in transcription regulation of host genes linked to innate immune response, via interactions with chromatin and the Mediator complex. Here we identified the MED25 Mediator subunit as an NS1 interactor in a yeast two-hybrid screen. We demonstrate that NS1 directly interacts with MED25 in vitro and in cellula, and that this interaction involves the MED25 transactivator binding ACID domain on the one hand, and the C-terminal α3 helix of NS1, with an additional contribution of the globular domain of NS1, on the other hand. By NMR we show that the NS1 α3 sequence primarily binds to the MED25 ACID H2 face, similarly to the α-helical transactivation domains (TADs) of transcription regulators such as Herpex simplex VP16 and ATF6α, a master regulator of ER stress response activated upon viral infection. Moreover, we found out that the NS1 could compete with ATF6α TAD for binding to MED25. These findings point to a mechanism of NS1 interfering with innate immune response by impairing recruitment by cellular TADs of the Mediator via MED25 and hence transcription of specific genes by RNA polymerase II.</td>

      <td>Ethnopharmacological relevance: Enantia chlorantha is traditionally used to treat various ailments including rickettsia fever, cough and wounds, typhoid fever, infective hepatitis, jaundice, and urinary tract infections. Aim of the study: To isolate the antibacterial constituents of the hydro-ethanolic extract of the stem bark of E. chlorantha (ECB) and to evaluate the antibacterial and antibiotic-modifying activities of ECB and its constituents against the multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes. Materials and methods: Chromatographic methods were used to isolate the constituents of ECB and Spectroscopic methods were used to elucidate the chemical structures of the isolated compounds. The antibacterial activity of samples was determined by the broth microdilution method while spectrophotometric methods were used to evaluate the effects of ECB and its most active constituent on bacterial growth. Their effects on bacterial proton-ATPase pumps was assessed through the acidification of the bacterial culture medium. Results: Six protoberberine alkaloids were isolated and identified as columbamine (1), pseudocolumbamine (2), jathrorrhizine (3), palmitine (4), 4,13-dihydroxy-3,9,10-trimethoxyprotoberberine (5), and 13-hydroxy-2,3,9,10-tetramethoxyprotoberberine (6). The crude extract (ECB) inhibited the growth of all the tested MDR bacteria, with the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values below 100 μg/mL obtained against Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, AG 102, Enterobacter aerogenes EA 27, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 11296 and KP 55, Providencia stuartii NEA 16, and Staphylococcus aureus MRSA3 and MRSA6. Compound 1 had the best antibacterial effects with MIC values ranging from 16 to 64 μg/mL. The efflux pump inhibitor (EPI), phenylalanine-arginine-β naphthylamide (PAβN) significantly improved the activity of compounds 1–6. Compounds 1–3 significantly potentiated the antibacterial activity of antibiotics such norfloxacin (NOR), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and doxycycline (DOX) against the tested MDR bacteria. Conclusion: The crude extract (ECB) and its isolated compounds 1–6 are potential antibacterial products from Enantia chlorantha. They could be explored more to develop the antibacterial agents that could be used alone or in combination with antibiotics to overcome MDR phenotypes.</td>

Biochar (BC) has been widely used to reduce the mobility of soil contaminants, however, its effect on the mobility of eARGs in porous media and the mechanisms are largely unknown. Herein, the effects of BCs synthesized from wheat straw and corn straw at two pyrolysis temperatures (300 °C and 700 °C) on the transport of plasmids-carried eARGs in sand column were investigated. The BC amendments all significantly decreased the mobility of eARGs in the porous medium, but the mechanism varied with pyrolysis temperature. The higher temperature BCs had a stronger irreversible adsorption of plasmids and greatly enhanced the attachment and straining effects on plasmids during transport, thus more effectively inhibited the mobility of eARGs. The lower temperature BCs had weaker adsorption, attachment, and straining effects on plasmids, but induced generation of hydroxyl radicals in the porous medium and thereby fragmented the plasmids and hindered the amplification of eARGs. These findings are of fundamental significance for the potential application of BC in controlling the vertical spread of eARGs in soil and vadose zones.</td>

      <td>Antibiotics’ (ATBs) occurrence in soil ecosystems has a relevant effect in the structure and functionality of edaphic microbial communities, mainly because of their amendment with manure and biosolids that alter their key ecological functions. In this study, the impact of eight widely consumed ATBs on a natural soil microbial community, characterized through 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, was evaluated. Changes induced by the ATBs in the growth of the soil microbiota and in the community-level physiological profiling (CLPP), using Biolog EcoPlates™, were measured as endpoint. The eight assayed ATBs lead to a significant decrease in the growth of soil microbial communities in a dose-dependent way, ordered by its effect as follows: chloramphenicol &gt; gentamycin &gt; erythromycin &gt; ampicillin &gt; penicillin &gt; amoxicillin &gt; tetracycline &gt; streptomycin. Chloramphenicol, gentamycin, and erythromycin adversely affected the physiological profile of the soil community, especially its ability to metabolize amino acids, carboxylic and ketonic acids and polymers. The analysis of the relationship between the physico-chemical properties of ATBs, as well as their mechanism of action, revealed that, except for the aminoglycosides, each ATB is influenced by a different physico-chemical parameters, even for ATBs of the same family. Significant effects were detected from 100 μg mL to 1, concentrations that can be found in digested sludge, biosolids and even in fertilized soils after repeated application of manure, so cumulative and long-term effects of these antibiotics on soil environment cannot be ruled out.</td>

Aim: We used a national pharmacovigilance database to assess which medications had the highest reported frequency of ED. Methods: The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was queried to identify medications with the highest frequency of ED adverse event reports from 2010 to 2020. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and testosterone were excluded because these medications are often used as treatments for men with ED. The 20 medications with the highest frequency of ED were included in the disproportionality analysis. Outcomes: Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRRs) and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: The 20 medications accounted for 6,142 reports of ED. 5-α reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) and neuropsychiatric medications accounted for 2,823 (46%) and 2,442 (40%) of these reports respectively. Seven medications showed significant levels of disproportionate reporting with finasteride and dutasteride having the highest PRRs: 110.03 (103.14–117.39) and 9.40 (7.83–11.05) respectively. The other medications are used in a wide variety of medical fields such as cardiology, dermatology, and immunology. Clinical Implications: Physicians should be familiar with these medications and understand their respective mechanisms of action, so that they may counsel patients appropriately and improve their quality of life. Strengths and Limitations: The strength of the study is its large sample size and that it captures pharmacologic trends on a national level. Quantitative and comparative “real-world” data is lacking for the most common medications associated with ED. The limitation is that the number of reported events does not establish causality and cannot be used to calculate ED incidence rates.

      <td>Paravertebral pseudoaneurysms are infrequent following vertebral augmentation but can be difficult to manage due to their proximity to the arterial supply of the spinal cord. Here, we present two distinct manifestations of this complication with associated anatomy and management. In the first, a pseudoaneurysm developed following radiofrequency ablation and kyphoplasty at the L2 and L4 levels. Direct puncture embolization initially failed to close the pseudoaneurysm, but stasis was ultimately achieved via trans-arterial embolization. In the second, vertebral augmentation at the T9 and T11-L3 levels was complicated by formation of a pseudoaneurysm fed by a segmental artery and a long paravertebral anastomotic vein. Due to the patient's poor medical status, intervention was not performed. Understanding vertebral arterial anatomy is crucial for preventing and treating vascular injury in vertebral augmentation.</td>

      <td>Distribution, sources, and potential risks of antibiotic resistance genes in wastewater treatment plant: A review</td>
      <td>Irrational use of antibiotics produces a large number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) act as important sources and sinks of ARGs, and play an important role in their generation, treatment, and dissemination. This study summarizes the types, concentrations, and factors of ARGs in WWTPs, investigates the sources of ARGs in wastewater, compares the removal efficiencies of different treatment processes on ARGs, and analyzes the potential risks of ARGs accumulation in effluent, sludge and their emission into the air. The results show that the main ARGs detected in the influent of WWTPs are the genes resistant to macrolides (ermB, ermF), tetracyclines (tetW, tetA, tetC), sulfonamides (sul1, sul2), and β-lactams (bla(OXA), bla(TEM)). The concentrations of ARGs in the influent of the WWTPs are 2.23 × 10(2)–3.90 × 10(9) copies/mL. Wastewater quality and microbial community are the dominant factors that affect the distribution characteristics of ARGs. The accumulation of ARGs in effluent, sludge, and aerosols pose potential risks to the regional ecological environment and human health. Based on these results, research trends with respect to ARGs in WWTPs are also prospected.</td>

      <td>Physiological characterisation of Corynebacterium uterequi associated with pregnancy complications in mares</td>
      <td>Increasing cases of equine infertility and early embryonic loss in the Western Cape, South Africa, were documented in recent years. These appeared to be associated with Corynebacterium uterequi isolated from the uteri of infected mares. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to investigate the physiology and potential pathogenicity of this bacterium. Histopathological analyses were conducted on five mares suffering from reproductive complications, and from which Corynebacterium strains were detected on culture of uterine swabs. The histopathology revealed that the mares suffered from various forms of endometritis, suggesting a potential role of Corynebacterium strains in the disease. An isolate from one of the biopsies, and 11 other tentatively identified C. uterequi isolates from the urogenital tracts of other mares, which all had a history of pregnancy complications, were subsequently identified using molecular techniques and characterised based on environmental stress tolerance, enzyme profiles, antibiotic susceptibility and ability to form biofilms. It was found that representatives of C. uterequi possessed several virulence-associated characteristics, including trypsin and urease activity, as well as the ability to form weakly adherent monoculture biofilms. Several isolates displayed resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In conclusion, this study provided some insight into the general physiology and pathogenic potential of C. uterequi, and points to the possible role of C. uterequi in the onset of equine pregnancy complications. Moreover, the ability to form biofilms suggests the potential for chronic infection, which was observed in 60% of the mares. Further research, however, is needed to implicate C. uterequi as an equine pathogen.</td>

      <td>The effect of Spondias mombin L. against Strongyloides venezuelensis: An in vitro approach</td>
      <td>Strongyloidiasis is a neglected tropical disease mainly caused by the nematode parasite Strongyloides stercoralis. Current treatment consists in the administration of ivermectin or, alternatively, albendazole (or analogues). Concerns regarding these drugs’ irregular cure rates and side effects, raise a need for therapeutic alternatives. In this study, we tested the in vitro effect of Spondias mombin L. ethanolic extract against the laboratory model for strongyloidiasis, Strongyloides venezuelensis. The ethanolic extract was further fractionated and each fraction was also tested. Tested fractions were analyzed through thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography (GC/MS). Our results showed that S. mombin extract and fractions had a better in vitro effect than ivermectin, particularly fraction 4 which showed the better results causing 100% mortality in 4 h after exposure to an extract concentration of 400 µg/mL of RPMI medium and caused 100% mortality 12 h after exposure to an extract concentration of 50 µg/mL. Scanning electron microscopy showed that this fraction caused both wrinkling and peeling of the parasites cuticle, whilst ivermectin only caused wrinkling. GC/MS showed a high percentage of monoaromatic phenolic lipids (3-R phenol and 3-R1 phenol), which were likely responsible for the anti-Strongyloides effect. The use of polyvinylpyrrolidone reduced the efficiency, thus raising a need for alertness when using this excipient. Our results suggest that S. mombin is a potential source of compounds that could be used for stongyloidiasis treatment.</td>

In this study, 97 and 28 S. aureus strains were isolated for analysis from 4262 samples of retail food and 61 samples food outbreaks with prevalence rate 2.28 % and 45.9 %, respectively in Jilin, China from 2014 to 2018. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of S. aureus isolates and characterize by antimicrobial resistance testing, virulence profiles, spa typing, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. 60 % (75/125) of the isolates contained at least enterotoxin genes including classic and new SEs genes as following: sea (40/125,32 %), see (36/125,28.8 %), sec (29/125,23.2 %), sell (29/125,23.2 %), seb (25/125,20 %), seh (22/125,17.6 %), sed (6/125,4.8 %), selq (6/125,4.8 %), and selk (6/125,4.8 %). In antimicrobial susceptibility tests, 59.2 % of the isolates (74/125) were considered as multi-drug-resistant isolates and four MRSA strains were all found with high multi-drug-resistance. Phenotype resistance to penicillin (94.4 %), erythromycin (84.2 %), clindamycin (63.9 %), and tetracycline (47.2 %) was observed which was corresponding with genotype resistance. The strains were classified to twenty-two sequence types (STs), fourteen clonal complexes (CCs), and forty-seven spa types. The predominant ST and spa types were ST1(22/125,17.6 %), ST25(20/125,16.00 %), ST398 (14/125,11.2 %) and t127 (20/125,16 %), t078 (14/125,11.2 %), t803 (7/125,5.6 %).

This study determined the molecular prevalence and antimicrobial-resistance of ESBL and AmpC β-lactamases E. coli in 155 sheep and goat flocks across Jordan by testing 948 milk samples. The samples were enriched in MacConkey broth, and then plated on MacConkey agar with cefotaxime. The presence of ESBL and AmpC genes in the E. coli isolates was determined by PCR and the resistance toward critically important antimicrobials was tested by disc diffusion. In total, 1016 E. coli isolates were isolated from the cefotaxime supplemented MacConkey, 382 isolates harbored ESBL genes and 54 harbored bla(CMY). The prevalence of bla(CTX-M), bla(TEM), bla(CMY) and bla(SHV) E. coli in the milk samples were 33.5 %, 31.7 %, 5.7 %. and 1.1 %, respectively. At the flock level, 30.3 % flocks had β-lactamase E. coli, specifically 25.2 %, 20.7 %, 5.2 % and 2.6 % had bla(CTX-M), bla(TEM), bla(CMY) and blaSHV E. coli, respectively. About 52.2 % of the isolates harbored both bla(CTX-M) and bla(TEM). A high percentage (&gt;59 %) of ESBL and AmpC β-lactamases E. coli resisted sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, tetracycline and nalidixic acid. Overall, 93.5 % and 96.3 % of ESBL and AmpC E. coli were resistant to ≥1 another antimicrobial class and 44.5 % and 44.4 % were resistant to ≥3 another antimicrobial class, respectively. This study shows that sheep and goat milk is a reservoir of multidrug resistant ESBL and AmpC β-lactamases E. coli, thus good hygienic practices and judicious antimicrobials use are important in small ruminants' farming.</td>

      <td>Biocidal compounds are frequently used as disinfectants in poultry industry and their widespread usage has risen concern due to the co-selection and persistence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. In this study, extended spectrum β-lactamase producing (ESBL) Escherichia coli isolates (n = 60) obtained from chicken meat were characterized by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and further tested for disinfectant and heavy metal resistance phenotypically and genotypically. Plasmid replicon types of these isolates were also determined. ESBL producing E. coli isolates were found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin (48.3 %) and gentamicin (15 %). The majority of these isolates (46.5 %) carried bla(CTX-M-55) gene. The isolates showed higher minimal inhibitory concentrations to cetylpyridinium chloride (90 %), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (50 %), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (46.7 %), triclosan (38.3 %), benzalkonium chloride (28.3 %), chlorhexidine (21.7 %), acriflavine (3.3 %), benzethonium chloride (1.7 %) and N-alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (1.7 %), but 18.3 % of the isolates were resistant to triclosan. Of the quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) tolerance genes, mdfA, sugE(c), ydgE and ydgF were most present in all isolates, but the qacE, qacG, oqxA and oqxB genes were not detected. Of genes mediating the heavy metal resistance, the zitB gene was detected in all isolates, whereas the copA and cueO genes were detected in 96.67 % and 95 % of isolates, respectively. The IncFIB plasmid was commonly present (93.3 %) in ESBL producing E. coli isolates. Consequently, given the detection of genes mediating disinfectant and heavy metal resistance commonly in ESBL producing E. coli isolates as well as high rate of MICs against disinfectant compounds, the use of QACs for decontamination of the facilities may not be as effective as expected in poultry sector in Turkey.</td>

However, little is known about spending on and utilization of drugs prescribed by otolaryngologists. Methods: Utilizing publicly available Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use data, we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 34 small-molecule drugs commonly prescribed by otolaryngologists (defined as 2017 Medicare Part D spending ≥$500 000) to Medicare beneficiaries. Prescription data was characterized by drug type (brand name vs generic). Primary outcomes for each prescription drug included the total annual cost and the total annual number of days supplied. Results: From 2013 to 2017, spending on drugs prescribed by otolaryngologists to Medicare beneficiaries decreased by $32.1 million ($131.7–$99.5 million; relative decrease 24.4%; compound annual growth rate [CAGR] −5.4%), while total utilization increased by 24.9 million days supplied (74.6–99.5 million; relative increase 33.3%; CAGR 5.9%). For brand name drugs, there was a decrease in spending ($71.1–$26.7 million; relative decrease −62.4%; CAGR −17.8%) and utilization (11.2–3.1 million days supplied; relative decrease −72.5%; CAGR −22.8%). In contrast, generic drugs demonstrated increased spending ($60.6–$72.8 million; relative increase 20.2%; CAGR 3.7%) and utilization (63.5–96.4 million days supplied; relative increase 51.9%; CAGR 8.7%). Conclusions: Spending on drugs prescribed by otolaryngologists to Medicare Part D beneficiaries declined between 2013 and 2017 in part due to a transition from brand name drugs to lower-cost generic equivalents.</td>

Data Sources: A literature search was conducted utilizing PubMed, MEDLINE, and clinicaltrials.gov with search terms of “finerenone” and “BAY94-8862.” Study Selection and Data Extraction: All available studies with human participants in English were considered. Studies were included if they investigated drug pharmacology, efficacy, and safety information. Data Synthesis: In addition to standard of care with a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi), finerenone lowered the risk of kidney disease progression (17.8% vs 21.1%) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease compared to placebo. Similarly, finerenone reduced cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease compared to placebo (12.4% vs 14.2%). Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: It is anticipated that finerenone will be added to therapy after a RASi and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, as tolerated, based on adverse events and potassium levels. Conclusions: Finerenone offers a unique approach to further delay the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It also provides another option for patients who cannot tolerate RASi or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors.</td>

      <td>Background: Data are limited regarding the incidence of thromboembolism post-hospital discharge among COVID-19 patients. Guidelines addressing the role of extended thromboprophylaxis for COVID-19 patients are limited and conflicting. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of post-discharge thromboembolic and bleeding events and the role of thromboprophylaxis among COVID-19 patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19 infection who were discharged from a University of Colorado Health (UCHealth) hospital between March 1, 2020, and October 31, 2020. The primary outcome was objectively confirmed thromboembolism within 35 days post-discharge. The main secondary outcome was the incidence of bleeding events within 35 days post-discharge. Outcomes were compared between those who received extended prophylaxis and those who did not. Results: A total of 1171 patients met the study criteria. A total of 13 (1.1%) of patients had a documented thromboembolic event and 10 (0.9%) patients had a documented bleeding event within 35 days post-discharge. None of the 132 patients who received extended prophylaxis had a thromboembolic event compared to 13 of 1039 who did not receive extended prophylaxis (0 and 1.3%, respectively; P =.383). The incidence of bleeding was higher among patients who received extended prophylaxis compared to those who did not (3.0% vs 0.6%, P =.019). Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that post-discharge extended prophylaxis may be beneficial for select COVID-19 patients, while carefully weighing the risk of bleeding. Application of our findings may assist institutions in development of thromboprophylaxis protocols for discharged COVID-19 patients.</td>

In this study, we aimed to investigate kidney health outcomes by assessing the prevalence of renal dysfunction and hypertension (HTN) in children with ALL at 1–5 years after ALL diagnosis. Methods: This was a single-center, cross-sectional study of children with ALL who were 1–5 years post diagnosis. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurements were calculated, and urine samples were collected to assess for protein/creatinine and albumin/creatinine. Blood pressure (BP) was determined by standard oscillometric technique, and children ≥6 years of age were eligible for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Results: Forty-five patients enrolled in the study, and 21 completed ABPMs. Fifteen patients (33%, 95% CI: 20%–49%) developed acute kidney injury (AKI) at least once. Thirteen (29%, 95% CI: 16%–44%) had hyperfiltration, and 11 (24%) had abnormal proteinuria and/or albuminuria. Prevalence of HTN based on clinic measurements was 42%. In the 21 ABPM patients, 14 had abnormal results (67%, 95% CI: 43%–85%), with the majority (11/21) demonstrating abnormal nocturnal dipping pattern. Conclusions: Among children with ALL, there is a high prevalence of past AKI. The presence of hyperfiltration, proteinuria, and/or albuminuria at 1–5 years after ALL diagnosis suggests real risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) over time. There is a high prevalence of HTN on casual BP readings and even higher prevalence of abnormal ABPM in this group. The high prevalence of impaired nocturnal dipping by ABPM indicates an increased risk for future cardiovascular or cerebral ischemic events.</td>

      <td>Irinotecan-induced hepatotoxicity can cause severe clinical complications in patients; however, the underlying mechanism and factors affecting hepatotoxicity have rarely been investigated. In this cross-sectional study, we screened all clinical, demographic, medication, and genetic variables among 126 patients receiving irinotecan and explored potential associations with the incidence and time to onset of irinotecan-induced hepatotoxicity. Approximately 38.9% of the patients suffered from hepatotoxicity after irinotecan administration. The presence of cardiovascular diseases increases the incidence of hepatotoxicity ≈2.9-fold and doubles the hazard of time to hepatotoxicity. Patients with liver metastasis had a &gt;4-fold higher risk of hepatotoxicity and a 3.5-fold increased hazard of time to hepatotoxicity compared to those without liver metastasis. Patients who took cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inducers had a 4.4-fold increased incidence of hepatotoxicity, and furthermore, concomitant use of platinum-based antineoplastics revealed 4.2 times the hazard of time to hepatotoxicity compared to those receiving antimetabolites. The cumulative dose of irinotecan (5-9 cycles) increased hepatotoxicity by 8.5 times. However, the genotypes and phenotypes of UGT1A1*28/*6 failed to be predictive factors of hepatotoxicity. The findings of this study suggest that irinotecan-induced hepatotoxicity is not directly associated with genetic variables but is mostly related to concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers and platinum, as well as the presence of liver metastasis and cardiovascular disease. Thus, close monitoring of liver function is recommended, especially in patients with liver impairment or using CYP3A inducers and platinum antineoplastic drugs, which may be the best way to prevent hepatotoxicity.</td>

      <td>Background and Aim: To date, little is known about the aneurysms of the bovine aortic arch, known as a “common brachiocephalic trunk (CBT)” from where the left carotid and innominate arteries bifurcate. Patient and Results: Here we report a case of a fungal pseudoaneurysm of the bovine aortic arch in a patient who had prior history of multiple aortic valve replacement, hepatitis C infection, and human immunodeficiency virus infection. A re-operative replacement of the aortic arch repair utilizing a bifurcated graft was successfully performed under deep hypothermia and selective antegrade cerebral perfusion. Pathological examination demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm of the CBT. Intraoperative cultures from the aneurysmal wall showed Aspergillus fumigatus. Discussion and Conclusion: we experienced a complex surgical repair of CBT pseudoaneurysm caused by Aspergillus species.</td>

A 5-year-old, neutered male, American Bulldog presented with localized unilateral erythematous macules, plaques, alopecia, comedones and hemorrhagic bullae involving the non-pigmented skin on left lateral ventral flank area. The presence of hyperplastic epidermis with keratinocyte dysplasia, superficial dermal elastosis, and multiple follicular cysts with occasional rupture (furunculosis) on histology, together with history and characteristic skin lesions was consistent solar dermatitis/actinic keratosis. Skin scrapings were negative and treatment for secondary pyoderma was initiated with oral clindamycin for 8 weeks. After 2 months of antibiotic therapy, the hemorrhagic bullae resolved; however, erythematous solar/actinic skin lesions with induration and comedones persisted. Topical application of imiquimod 5% cream 3 times weekly for 8 weeks resulted in the resolution of erythema, but some of the non-inflamed comedones remained. Staining for elastin and Ki67 revealed keratinocyte hyperplasia in hair follicle infundibulums and alterations in the elastic fibers around follicles, which may lead to closure and formation of follicular cysts. Imiquimod has been long suggested as a treatment option for solar dermatitis, but this is the first known case report detailing its efficacy in dogs.</td>

Ulcerated nodules with hematic crusts were observed on the dorsal surface of the right and left pinna and on the metacarpal, metatarsal, and digits. Complete blood count, serum biochemistry, aspiration cytology of cutaneous lesions, biopsy for histopathological evaluation, culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing to identify mycobacterial species were performed. According to the clinical and histopathological findings, a diagnosis of CLG was established. Despite the negative result of the bacterial culture, mycobacterial identification was made by sequencing the hsp65 gene. Our findings highlight that mycobacterial species closely related to members of the M simiae clade can be causative agents of CLG.</td>

      <td>Berberine-mediated REDD1 down-regulation ameliorates senescence of retinal pigment epithelium by interrupting the ROS-DDR positive feedback loop</td>
      <td>Background: Accumulation of age-associated senescent cells accompanied with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory factors contributes to the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the main cause of blindness in the elderly. Berberine (BBR) has shown efficacy in the treatment of age-related diseases including diabetes and obesity by decreasing ROS. However, the pharmacological effect of BBR on alleviating retinal aging remains largely unknown. Purpose: Our study aimed to investigate the pharmacological effect of BBR as an anti-aging agent in retinal aging and its further molecular mechanisms. Methods: D-galactose (DG)-induced ARPE-19 cell senescence and retinal aging were employed to evaluate the anti-aging effect of BBR in vivo and in vitro. The siRNA transfection, Western-Blot analyses, SA-β-Gal assay and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the potential mechanisms of BBR on anti-aging of RPE. Results: In RPE-choroid of both natural aged and DG-induced accelerated aged mice, oxidative stress was increased along with the up-regulation of p21 expression, which was ameliorated by BBR treatment. BBR down-regulated the expression of REDD1 to decrease intracellular ROS content, attenuating DG-induced senescence in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, p53 instead of HIF-1α was identified as the transcriptional regulator of REDD1 in DG-induced premature senescence. Importantly, NAC and BBR reversed the expression of p53 and the content of 8-OHdG, indicating that the positive feedback loop of ROS-DNA damage response (DDR) was formed, and BBR interrupted this feedback loop to alleviate DG-induced premature senescence by reducing REDD1 expression. In addition, BBR restored DG-damaged autophagy flux by up-regulating TFEB-mediated lysosomal biosynthesis by inhibiting REDD1 expression, thereby attenuating cellular senescence. Conclusion: BBR down-regulates REDD1 expression to interrupt the ROS-DDR positive feedback loop and restore autophagic flux, thereby reducing premature senescence of RPE. Our findings elucidate the promising effects of REDD1 on cellular senescence and the great potential of BBR as a therapeutic approach.</td>

Methods: This study is a multicentre, retrospective study. CRE screening positive patients from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018 of high-risk departments in five tertiary first-class teaching hospitals in Beijing collect the patients’ CRE test specimen information, CRE infection information and outcomes. The patients were divided into a colonisation group and an infection group for comparative analysis. A logistic regression model was established to explore the risk factors of CRE infection. Subgroup analysis was conducted according to invasive procedures and the type of the infection. Results: In total, 344 patients were included in this study, including 85 (24.71%) colonisation and 259 (75.29%) infection; 36.09% CRE colonisation converted to infection, and the mean conversion time from colonisation to infection was 6.5 (4.0, 18.8) days. Renal disease, granulocytosis, invasive procedures and the time from hospital stay to positive CRE were the risk factors for CRE infection. The subgroup analysis showed that the rate of CRE infection in the invasive group was higher than in the non-invasive group (P &lt; 0.001), and the rate of exacerbation or death in the invasive group was also higher than in the non-invasive group (P = 0.019). The average length of ICU and hospitalisation in the healthcare-associated infection group were significantly higher than those in the community infection group, but there was no difference in the proportion of final exacerbation or death between them (P = 0.727). Conclusion: Kidney disease, granulocytosis, invasive procedures and CRE detection time are the risk factors for CRE infection. Carrying out CRE screening in patients as early as possible and taking effective intervention measures in time to avoid adverse consequences is all important.</td>

Long-term high-fat diet can cause obesity in mice, and the process of lipophagy is inhibited, which may be one of the reasons for fat accumulation. Eight weeks of aerobic exercise can effectively reduce the weight of obese mice and promote lipolysis; this process is mainly completed by lipase decomposition, in addition to require the participation of the lipophagy process.</td>

Methods: Clinical samples were collected from paediatric patients with a suspected diagnosis of GAS infections. We studied the annual incidence and characteristics of GAS infections using the GAS antigen detection method. Additionally, 250 GAS isolates were randomly selected for genotyping of the emm gene, and antimicrobial susceptibility assay was performed using the Kirby-Bauer paper dispersion strategy. Results: Among 43 593 collected samples, 9313 were positive for the GAS antigen. The main emm type was emm12, followed by emm1, emm6, and emm 4, which were used for distinguishing 90% of the scarlet fever isolated strains. The percentage of emm1 increased from 36% in 2016 to 44% in 2019, whereas the percentage of emm12 decreased from 62% to 50%. Several unusual emm types isolated from scarlet fever patients showed an increase in proportions from 2016 to 2020. These GAS isolates were sensitive to penicillin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin and were highly resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. Conclusion: There was a high incidence of GAS infections during 2016–2020 in Shenzhen, China. The GAS isolates had a high resistance rate to erythromycin and clindamycin; penicillin was the antibiotic of choice for GAS infections. The common emm types were emm12 and emm1. Future studies should investigate the clonal structure and superantigen profiles of the population of GAS isolates associated with scarlet fever.</td>

Methods: E. fergusonii was isolated by selective medium and screened from tigecycline-supplemented agar plates. The microbroth dilution method was used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) results refer to the interpretation standard in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute of America (CLSI). Whole-genome sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq and Nanopore GridION platforms. The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes virulence genes and replicon types of plasmids were predicted by the CGE server. Results: E. fergusonii EF21QZZ116 was identified from 760 faecal and caecal content samples and was resistant to tigecycline, tetracycline, ampicillin, sulfisoxazole, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, spectinomycin, and florfenicol. The AMR genes tet(X4), bla(TEM-1B), and floR are located on the hybrid IncFIA-IncHI1A-IncHI1B plasmid pQZZ166-tetX-190K and are 190 391 bp in length. This hybrid plasmid has high homology with the plasmids of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, and Salmonella based on comparison and analysis with the NCBI database. Notably, conjugative transfer and S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE) assays show that the plasmid can transfer horizontally. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of E. fergusonii carrying the tet(X4) gene isolated from a pig; this report provides insight into the AMR characteristics of E. fergusonii and offers insight into public health.</td>

Methods: Clinical information was collected from all the patients. Reverse transcription–PCR and ELISAs were conducted for the detection of COVID-19 using nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was performed for the identification of causative pathogens using BALF, peripheral blood and sputum samples. End-point PCR was performed to confirm the mNGS results. Results: All 32 patients showed atypical pneumonia and had infection-like symptoms that were similar to COVID-19. Results of reverse transcription–PCR and ELISAs ruled out COVID-19 infection. mNGS identified C. psittaci as the suspected pathogen in these patients within 48 hours, which was validated by PCR, except for three blood samples. The sequence reads that covered fragments of C. psittaci genome were detected more often in BALF than in sputum or blood samples. All patients received doxycycline-based treatment regimens and showed favorable outcomes. Conclusion: This retrospective study, with the highest number of C. psittaci pneumonia enrolled cases in China so far, suggests that human psittacosis may be underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed clinically, especially in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</td>

      <td>Objectives: : Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) represent a public health concern. The limited antimicrobial options against CPE have led to the development of novel antimicrobial molecules. In the present study, we characterized the genetic determinants associated with the resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ-AVI), meropenem/vaborbactam (MER-VAB), imipenem/relebactam (IMI-REL) and cefiderocol (CFD) in a carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strain isolated from a critically ill patient. Methods: : Genomic DNA was sequenced using Illumina iSeq 100 and Minion Oxford Nanopore platforms. Assemblies were performed with a de novo approach using short-read, hybrid and long-lead assembly approaches. Final assembly was manually curated and carefully verified. Circular elements were screened for antimicrobial-resistance genes, porins, virulence factors and prophage regions. Results: : KPC-Kp (KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae) BO743 was resistant to all novel β-lactams including CAZ-AVI, MER-VAB, IMI-REL and CFD. The genome of strain BO743 is composed of a single chromosome of 5 347 606 bp and three circular plasmids of 363 634 bp (pBO743-363Kb), 120 290 bp (pBO743-120Kb) and 54 339 bp (pBO743-54Kb).

Method: A total of 117 CR-Eco strains, collected between 2012.01 and 2019.12, underwent fully automated bacterial identification and sensitization using VITEK-2 Compact and supplemented by K–B assay. PCR was employed to screen for class 1 integrase genes and integron variable regions, while the promoter type and variable region gene cassette characteristics were determined by sequencing analysis. Results: The positive rate of the class 1 integron of the CR-Eco strains was 83.70% (92/117) herein. Moreover, class 1 integrase-positive strains exhibited statistically significant resistance to aztreonam, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, meropenem, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to integron-negative strains (P &lt; 0.05). Variable regions were observed in 77 of the 92 class 1 integrase-positive strains. In addition, seven gene cassettes were detected, namely dfrA17-aadA5, aadA22, dfrA12-aadA2, dfrA12, dfrA17, dfrA27 and aadA. Finally, five types of class 1 integron variable region promoters were identified in those 77 strains, including PcW, PcH1, PcW(TGN-10), PcH1(TGN-10), and P2, which were detected in 48, 18, 8, 2, and 1 strains, respectively. Conclusion: The primary integrator variable region gene cassettes of this class were dfrA and aadA.

      <td>The healthy immune system eliminates pathogens and maintains tissue homeostasis through extraordinarily complex networks with feedback systems while avoiding potentially massive tissue destruction. Many parameters influence humoral and cellular vaccine responses, including intrinsic and extrinsic, environmental, and behavioral, nutritional, perinatal and administrative parameters. The relative contributions of persisting antibodies and immune memory as well as the determinants of immune memory induction, to protect against specific diseases are the main parameters of long-term vaccine efficacy. Natural and vaccine-induced immunity and monoclonal antibody immunotherapeutic, may be evaded by SARS-CoV-2 variants. Besides the complications of the production of COVID-19 vaccinations, there is no effective single treatment against COVID-19. However, administration of a combined treatment at different stages of COVID-19 infection may offer some cure assistance. Combination treatment of antiviral drugs and immunomodulatory drugs may reduce inflammation in critical COVID-19 patients with cytokine release syndrome. Molnupiravir, remdesivir and paxlovid are the approved antiviral agents that may reduce the recovery time. In addition, immunomodulatory drugs such as lactoferrin and monoclonal antibodies are used to control inflammatory responses in their respective auto-immune conditions. Therefore, the widespread occurrence of highly transmissible variants like Delta and Omicron indicates that there is still a lot of work to be done in designing efficient vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.

      <td>Population structure, susceptibility profile, phenotypic and mating properties of Candida tropicalis isolated from pediatric patients</td>
      <td>Background: Candida tropicalis is one of the most frequently isolated species and is commonly associated with nosocomial infections, hematological malignancy, neutropenia, and urinary tract infections. Aims: This study aims to genotype C. tropicalis strains isolated from pediatric patients admitted to two hospitals in Ahvaz, Iran. We provide a vision of the genotypes, mating types, enzymatic activity, phenotypes, and antifungal susceptibility profile of these isolates. Methods: Candida tropicalis isolates were collected from various clinical (Oral, urine, wound, and bronchoalveolar lavage) and environmental sources between November 2020 and November 2021. Primitively, samples were cultured on CHROMagar Candida. All isolates were identified by sequencing the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region for precise identification. Isolates were genotyped by six microsatellite markers specific for C. tropicalis. Antifungal susceptibility profiles were determined against eight antifungal agents according to CLSI M27 standards. The phenotype of each C. tropicalis isolate was assessed using yeast peptone dextrose agar supplemented with phloxine B. Mating types of C. tropicalis isolates were determined using MTLa1 and MTL2 specific primers. Results: Species identification revealed 46 C. tropicalis strains. Among them, 39 different genotypes were detected that have split into 34 singletons and five clusters. Twenty isolates were the non-wild type for itraconazole and posaconazole. Four isolates were multidrug-resistant. The activity of hemolysin and esterase enzyme was very strong among all isolates. Mating type and phenotype were not significantly correlated with genotypes (p = 0.721 and p = 0.135, respectively). Conclusions: To conclude, tested populations were moderately differentiated with high gene flow. One cluster of isolates among different hospitals was identified, and three clusters were from different cities.</td>

      <td>The objective of this study is to confirm the efficacy and safety of lurasidone in the acute treatment of schizophrenia in European patients. Data were pooled from three studies of patients randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose (40/80 mg and 120/160 mg) lurasidone. The primary efficacy endpoint was a week 6 change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score and secondary endpoints included the Clinical Global Impression, Severity scale (CGI-S). In total 328 safety patients were enrolled; 72.6% were completers. Endpoint change was significantly greater in patients treated with 40-80 mg/d and 120-160 mg/d compared to placebo on the PANSS total score ( P  &lt; 0.001) and the CGI-Severity score ( P  &lt; 0.001) for all comparisons. For PANSS total scores, endpoint effect sizes for lurasidone 40-80 mg/d and 120-160 mg/d were 0.68 to 0.77, respectively. Adverse events with a frequency ≥5% (and were greater than for combined lurasidone) were insomnia (11.7%), akathisia (11.3%), headache (7.4%), Parkinsonism (6.5%) and nausea (5.7%). Median changes (in mg/dL) at endpoint were minimal for total cholesterol (-8.0); triglycerides (-8.5) and glucose (-2.0) and in mean weight (-0.2 kg). In European patients with schizophrenia, short-term treatment with lurasidone in doses of 40-160 mg/d was generally safe, well-tolerated and effective with minimal effects on weight and metabolic parameters.</td>

      <td>Switching antipsychotic medication must be done carefully to ensure patient safety and a successful response. Here, we present two major psychotic decompensations that occurred following a switch to aripiprazole in two patients with schizophrenia. Mr. X was treated with paliperidone and experienced residual anxiety. Thus, a switch to aripiprazole was planned with risperidone and a gradual decrease in paliperidone. Initially, an increase in aripiprazole resulted in remission of his residual symptoms. However, two weeks later, he presented an anxiety relapse with persecutory ideas which required hospitalization. Mr. Y, who was treated for many years with risperidone, presented with a treatment resistant psychotic episode. A switch to aripiprazole enhanced his clinical condition. Despite the initial improvement, soon after discharge from the hospital, the patient presented psychotic symptoms requiring home intervention. Ultimately, the patient in the midst of a delusional recrudescence, had killed himself when the health care team arrived. A strong dopamine antagonist may lead to the development of dopaminergic upregulation. The addition of a partial agonist to these hypersensitive neurotransmitter pathways could explain these episodes. We agree with previous reports and recommend careful management when switching from strong dopamine antagonists to aripiprazole.</td>

      <td>Urea hydrolysis and long-term storage of source-separated urine for reuse as fertiliser is insufficient for the removal of anthropogenic micropollutants</td>
      <td>Human and animal source-separated urine, stored and allowed to naturally hydrolyse (the bio-catalysed transformation of urea to ammonia and bicarbonate), has been used for millennia as a fertiliser in agriculture. In a context of growing water scarcity and climate uncertainty, source-separation of urine is facing a strong revival thanks to the emergence of cost-effective waterless collection systems. Concomitantly, urine source-separation can be used as a method for nutrient recovery and subsequent reuse. In its simplest form, such recovery consists of collection followed by urea hydrolysis and storage as sole treatment. Numerous guidelines, including by the World Health Organisation, consider that this is sufficient to stabilise the nutrients and inactivate any potential pathogens in the urine. However, it is still unclear whether said urine is effectively free from other compounds of concern, such as anthropogenic micropollutants with known toxicological effects. Moreover, it is also currently unknown if the metabolites produced by human consumption of these products behave in similar way during short- and long-term storage i.e. whether any changes in chemical structure mean that these could be sorbed and/or precipitated in a different way, or if they can potentially be degraded by the biomass inherently present in urine collection systems. Finally, there is currently no knowledge of whether the observed concentrations of micropollutants in stored hydrolysed urine could potentially have toxicological effects if/when applied to soils and edible crops. To fill these research gaps, 20 commonly consumed compounds were selected in this study and their concentrations in the liquid and solid phases studied in the short- and long-term (up to ≥ 2 years). During the initial process of urea hydrolysis (≤ 5 days), ethyl-glucuronide was the sole compound effectively removed (by deconjugation), while only two other compounds, erythromycin and its metabolite, saw a reduction in their concentration (likely due to biomass sorption). Subsequently, during early storage (≤ 15 days), only three additional compounds were removed: paracetamol (&gt; 99%), acesulfame (11.5%) and carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide (40.7%). Finally, long-term storage of up to 24 months did not result in any further significant removal for any of the measured compounds, indicating that the procedure of hydrolysis + storage is not effective for the removal of anthropogenic micropollutants. The results of this investigation raise strong concerns about the direct reuse of hydrolysed/stored human source-separated urine, and evidence the need for post-processing before implementation as fertiliser into edible crops due to the inherent toxicological risk, particularly to infants.</td>

      <td>Paliperidone-Associated Sialorrhea: A Case Report With Review of Current Literature</td>
      <td>PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic-associated sialorrhea is a problematic adverse effect with potentially negative consequences on quality of life and medication adherence. While clozapine is the antipsychotic that is most associated with sialorrhea, there have been published reports of other second-generation antipsychotics associated with sialorrhea, including aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. Although drooling is mentioned within the package insert for paliperidone, to date there have been minimal published reports in which paliperidone is implicated as the offending agent. METHODS/PROCEDURES: Here, we present a case of sialorrhea in a 56-year-old male with schizoaffective disorder who had a supratherapeutic paliperidone level after both oral and intramuscular paliperidone use. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Paliperidone was ultimately cross tapered to aripiprazole, and the patient was given atropine drops and benztropine with resolution of the sialorrhea. We provide a review of the literature regarding the other available reports of paliperidone-associated sialorrhea, possible mechanisms behind pathophysiology, as well as reports from the World Health Organization and Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting systems. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the potential for paliperidone and other nonclozapine second-generation antipsychotics to be associated with sialorrhea, especially given the increased frequency of their use for a variety of psychiatric disorders.</td>

      <td>In Vitro Susceptibility Testing of Eravacycline against Nontuberculous Mycobacteria</td>
      <td>Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections are increasing worldwide. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and the M. abscessus species are the most commonly cultured NTM and treatment options are limited, especially for the M. abscessus species. In this study, the in vitro activity of eravacycline, a new tetracycline derivative, was tested against 110 clinical isolates of NTM. MIC testing was performed as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute against 60 isolates of rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM), of which ~70% were tetracycline resistant. These included M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (8 isolates), M. abscessus subsp. massiliense (5), M. chelonae (10), M. immunogenum (3), M. fortuitum group (20) including 12 doxycycline-resistant isolates, and M. mucogenicum group (10) including three doxycycline-resistant isolates. Due to trailing, eravacycline MICs were read at 80% and 100% inhibition. Eravacycline was active against all RGM species, with MIC50 ranges of ≤0.015 to 0.5 and ≤0.015 to 0.12 μg/mL for 100% and 80% inhibition, respectively. For M. abscessus subsp. abscessus, MIC50 values were 0.12 and 0.03 μg/mL with 100% and 80% inhibition, respectively. MICs for tigecycline were generally within 1 to 2 dilutions of the 100%-inhibition eravacycline MIC values. Fifty isolates of slowly growing mycobacteria (SGM) species, including 16 isolates of MAC, were also tested. While there was no trailing observed in most SGM, the eravacycline MICs were higher (MIC range of &gt;8 μg/mL), except for M. kansasii and M. marinum which had MIC50 values of 1 μg/mL. This study supports further evaluation of eravacycline, including clinical trials for the development of RGM treatment regimens, especially for M. abscessus.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: There has been an emergence of recalcitrant, recurrent, and difficult-to-treat tinea. Monotherapy with oral antifungals leads to partial clearance or high recurrence of lesions. Isotretinoin is a good adjuvant to systemic antifungals in chronic dermatophytosis. Voriconazole could be a future alternative due to its efficacy against dermatophytes and little resistance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral itraconazole, combined itraconazole/isotretinoin therapy, and voriconazole for recalcitrant tinea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 90 patients with chronic, recurrent, and/or recalcitrant tinea. They were equally divided into 3 groups: itraconazole monotherapy, combined itraconazole/isotretinoin therapy, and voriconazole monotherapy. All patients received treatments for 6 weeks. The clinical response was classified as either a complete or incomplete clinical cure. Potassium hydroxide microscopy and culture were performed to identify mycological cure. Patients with complete cure were followed up for another 6 months to detect any recurrence. RESULTS: Complete clinical cure was observed in 53.3% of the itraconazole group, 70% of the itraconazole/isotretinoin group, and 83.3% of the voriconazole group. Mycological cure was detected in 56.7% of the itraconazole group, 83.3% of the itraconazole/isotretinoin group, and 86.7% of the voriconazole group. There was a statistically significant difference between the three groups in favor of voriconazole, then the combined group. No significant adverse effects were observed. The recurrence rate was significantly lower in the voriconazole group compared to the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Voriconazole could be a future alternative for the treatment of recalcitrant dermatophytosis.</td>

In this study, we evaluated emtricitabine (F, FTC)/tenofovir disoporoxil fumarate (TDF) pharmacokinetics among adolescent and young adult transgender persons receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). This was a prospective, observational study among transgender women (TW) and men (TM) without HIV ages 15-24 receiving GAHT (estradiol with/without spironolactone, or testosterone). Participants received one month of directly observed daily F/TDF. Weekly convenience blood samples were collected for plasma TFV and FTC, and intracellular TFV-diphosphate (TFV-DP) and FTC-triphosphate (FTC-TP) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and dried blood spots (DBS). After 2-3 weeks of F/TDF dosing, intensive PK sampling was conducted. PK parameters were estimated using noncompartmental methods. Data were log-transformed and compared between TM and TW, and to historical data among cisgender adults. Plasma TFV exposures were similar between TM and TW (GMR [95% CI]: 1.06 [0.89-1.28]), whereas FTC plasma exposures were 21% higher in TM vs. TW (95% CI: 1.07-1.38). TFV-DP in PBMC and DBS and FTC-TP in DBS did not differ between TM vs. TW after controlling for CrCl, but FTC-TP in PBMC remained 46% (95% CI: 1.15-1.86) higher in TM vs. TW. All PK exposures were within expected ranges based on historical studies. TM had higher FTC exposures compared with TW, but overall plasma and intracellular exposures for both drugs were within the range of historical studies suggesting high PrEP efficacy will be retained in adolescent and young adult transgender persons.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND Bacteriuria occurs in many pregnant women which may result in symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), including acute pyelonephritis (APN), which can lead to septic shock. However, there was no standard protocol of managing pregnant women with APN about the regimen, timing, length of antibiotic appliance as well as the indication of implanting double-J ureteral stents in those with kidney stones. CASE REPORT A 26-year-old pregnant woman (G1P0, 27 weeks plus 3 days) presented to our hospital on account of fever and pain in the flanks and was admitted on account of suspected UTI due to bacteriuria and elevated inflammatory markers. Elevated WBC count of 18.26×10⁹/L, PCT of 2.75, CRP of 198 mg/L, existence of kidney stones, renal and perirenal inflammation were observed. Cefoperazone sodium sulbactam sodium was given. The patient experienced septic shock on day 2 with a low blood pressure of 81/52 mmHg. Double-J ureteral stents were implanted due to upper urinary tract obstruction on day 3 with continuous use of meropenem based on urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity results. From day 7, the antibiotics were changed to cefoperazone-sulbactam. The patient's laboratory results (biochemistry, PCT, and CRP) all gradually went to normal, and she was discharged on day 15. CONCLUSIONS We learned that urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity examination were suggested after bacteriuria was observed in pregnant women to guide further treatment. Once APN was suspected, antibiotic therapy should be commenced and early-stage drainage by double-J ureteral stents could be considered if warranted in appropriate patients.</td>

      <td>Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention of COVID-19</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Recruitment into randomized trials of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for prevention of COVID-19 has been adversely affected by a widespread conviction that HCQ is not effective for prevention. In the absence of an updated systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials that study the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19. METHODS: A search of PubMed, medRxiv, and clinicaltrials.gov combined with expert consultation found 11 completed randomized trials: 7 pre-exposure prophylaxis trials and 4 post-exposure prophylaxis trials. We obtained or calculated the risk ratio of COVID-19 diagnosis for assignment to HCQ versus no HCQ (either placebo or usual care) for each trial, and then pooled the risk ratio estimates. RESULTS: The pooled risk ratio estimate of the pre-exposure prophylaxis trials was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58-0.90) when using either a fixed effect or a standard random effects approach, and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55-0.95) when using a conservative modification of the Hartung-Knapp random effects approach. The corresponding estimates for the post-exposure prophylaxis trials were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.72-1.16) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.62-1.35). All trials found a similar rate of serious adverse effects in the HCQ and no HCQ groups. DISCUSSION: A benefit of HCQ as prophylaxis for COVID-19 cannot be ruled out based on the available evidence from randomized trials. However, the "not statistically significant" findings from early prophylaxis trials were widely interpreted as definite evidence of lack of effectiveness of HCQ. This interpretation disrupted the timely completion of the remaining trials and thus the generation of precise estimates for pandemic management before the development of vaccines.</td>

      <td>Case Report: Multiple Scalp Abscesses due to Mycobacterium abscessus Infection Following Triamcinolone Injection in an Immunocompetent Person</td>
      <td>Mycobacterium abscessus complex is a group of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). The NTM may involve skin, soft tissue, and other organs like the eye and central nervous system. Clinically may mimic multidrug resistance. Here, we present a case of a 29-year man with a history of multiple scalp swellings with mild symptoms. He had undergone multiple triamcinolone acetonide injections on his scalp to stop hair fall and baldness 2 months prior. As there was a history of injections on the scalp and lesions associated with minimal symptoms, we suspected the possibility of NTM and fungal infections. As a part of treatment and obtaining a sample for investigation, lesions were aspirated with a needle. The swellings contained gelatinous material, which was sent for microscopic examination, and revealed the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Xpert MTB/RIF assay was negative for mycobacteria (MTB complex), but culture revealed NTM, identified as M. abscessus complex by line probe assay. Based on the diagnosis, the patient was treated with an injection of amikacin, moxifloxacin, and azithromycin. The lesions improved. The patient has completed over a year of follow-up with no recurrence noted. Mycobacterium abscessus, a rapidly growing NTM, has been occasionally reported to cause cutaneous soft tissue infection when injected with nonsterile medicine or needles. Therefore, a high index of suspicion for NTM infection is warranted in patients with cutaneous scalp abscess following scalp injections for hair loss.</td>

      <td>In this study, spent tea powder waste was chemically treated for the synthesis of adsorbent using two activating agents, i.e., sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, to obtain sulfuric acid activated carbon (SAC) and phosphoric acid activated carbon (PAC). The performance of PAC and SAC for the sorption of tetracycline (TCY) and sulfadiazine (SDZ) antibiotics from mono-component (SDZ/TCY) and multi-component (SDZ + TCY) adsorption systems was investigated. Synergistic and antagonistic effects were studied in removing target pollutants in SDZ + TCY systems. Kinetic and equilibrium studies were modeled by different kinetic and isotherm models. The adsorption capacity was assessed using Langmuir's competitive model in a [Formula: see text]. Pseudo-first-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models best fit the experimental kinetic and equilibrium data to remove antibiotics. The Langmuir's maximum adsorption capacity (qm) of PAC for the removal of SDZ and TCY in a [Formula: see text] was found to be 16.75 and 10.87 mg/g, and qm of SAC for the removal of SDZ and TCY was found to be 24.69 and 23.20 mg/g, respectively. In SDZ + TCY multi-component system, adsorption of TCY was synergistic in nature for both PAC and SAC. Sorption of SDZ displayed an antagonistic effect in the SDZ + TCY system for both SAC and PAC. In conclusion, the activated carbons synthesized from spent tea waste could be effectively adopted for the simultaneous adsorption of SDZ and TCY from multi-component systems.</td>

      <td>Doxycycline responding illnesses in returning travellers with undifferentiated non-malaria fever: a european multicenter prospective cohort study</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of undifferentiated non-malaria fevers (NMF) in returning travellers is a great challenge. Currently, there is no consensus about the use of empirical antibiotics in returning travellers with undifferentiated non-malaria fevers (NMF). Although studies in endemic areas showed that a wide range of pathogens implicated in undifferentiated NMF are treatable with doxycycline, the role of doxycycline in returning travellers with fever still has to be explored. METHODS: Prospective European multicenter cohort study of febrile international travellers (November 2017-November 2019). Immunological and molecular diagnostic techniques for doxycycline responding illnesses (DRI) agents such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Spotted Fever Group Rickettsia spp., Typhus Group Rickettsia spp., Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella spp., Orientia tsutsugamushi, Borrelia miyamotoi, Borrelia recurrentis and Leptospira spp. were systematically performed in all patients with undifferentiated NMF. We estimated the prevalence and predictive factors of DRI in returning travellers with undifferentiated NMF. RESULTS: Among 347 travellers with undifferentiated NMF, 106 (30·5%) were finally diagnosed with DRI. Only 57 (53·8%) of the 106 DRI infections were diagnosed by the standard of care. The main causes of DRI were: 55 (51·9%) Rickettsia spp., 16 (15·1%) C. burnetii; 15 (14·2%) Bartonella spp.; 13 (12·3%) Leptospira spp.; and 10 (9·5%) A. phagocytophilum. The only predictive factor associated with DRI was presenting an eschar (aOR 39·52, 95%CI 4·85-322·18). Features of dengue such as retro-orbital pain (aOR 0·40, 95%CI 0·21-0·76) and neutropenia (aOR 0·41, 95%CI 0·21-0·79) were negatively associated with DRI. CONCLUSIONS: Although DRI are responsible for 30% of undifferentiated NMF cases in travellers, those are seldom recognized during the first clinical encounter. Empirical treatment with doxycycline should be considered in returning travellers with undifferentiated fever and negative tests for malaria and dengue, particularly when presenting severe illness, predictive factors for rickettsiosis or no features of dengue.</td>

      <td>Should RECOVERY have used response adaptive randomisation? Evidence from a simulation study</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial is aimed at addressing the urgent need to find effective treatments for patients hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The trial has had many successes, including discovering that dexamethasone is effective at reducing COVID-19 mortality, the first treatment to reach this milestone in a randomised controlled trial. Despite this, it continues to use standard or 'fixed' randomisation to allocate patients to treatments. We assessed the impact of implementing response adaptive randomisation within RECOVERY using an array of performance measures, to learn if it could be beneficial going forward. This design feature has recently been implemented within the REMAP-CAP platform trial. METHODS: Trial data was simulated to closely match the data for patients allocated to standard care, dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine, or lopinavir-ritonavir in the RECOVERY trial from March-June 2020, representing four out of five arms tested throughout this period. Trials were simulated in both a two-arm trial setting using standard care and dexamethasone, and a four-arm trial setting utilising all above treatments. Two forms of fixed randomisation and two forms of response-adaptive randomisation were tested. In the two-arm setting, response-adaptive randomisation was implemented across both trial arms, whereas in the four-arm setting it was implemented in the three non-standard care arms only. In the two-arm trial, randomisation strategies were performed at the whole trial level as well as within three pre-specified patient subgroups defined by patients' respiratory support level. RESULTS: All response-adaptive randomisation strategies led to more patients being given dexamethasone and a lower mortality rate in the trial. Subgroup specific response-adaptive randomisation reduced mortality rates even further. In the two-arm trial, response-adaptive randomisation reduced statistical power compared to FR, with subgroup level adaptive randomisation exhibiting the largest power reduction. In the four-arm trial, response-adaptive randomisation increased statistical power in the dexamethasone arm but reduced statistical power in the lopinavir arm. Response-adaptive randomisation did not induce any meaningful bias in treatment effect estimates nor did it cause any inflation in the type 1 error rate. CONCLUSIONS: Using response-adaptive randomisation within RECOVERY could have increased the number of patients receiving the optimal COVID-19 treatment during the trial, while reducing the number of patients needed to attain the same study power as the original study. This would likely have reduced patient deaths during the trial and lead to dexamethasone being declared effective sooner. Deciding how to balance the needs of patients within a trial and future patients who have yet to fall ill is an important ethical question for the trials community to address. Response-adaptive randomisation deserves to be considered as a design feature in future trials of COVID-19 and other diseases.</td>

      <td>Quantitative bacterial counts in the bone marrow of Vietnamese patients with typhoid fever</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Bone marrow culture (BMC) is the reference standard for typhoid fever diagnosis. We studied the additional yield of BMC over blood culture (BC) and the relationship between quantitative BMC counts and severe disease. METHODS: Hospitalised Vietnamese patients with suspected typhoid fever were prospectively investigated with a BC, BMC, faecal culture and quantitative BMC counts. RESULTS: Salmonella typhi was isolated in 195 of 231 patients: from BC and BMC in 144 (73.8%), from BMC alone in 33 (16.9%), from BC alone in 12 (6.2%) and from faeces alone in 6 (3.1%). In 167 patients the median extracellular count of S. typhi was 2.5 cfu/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 0-10) and the intracellular count was 10.5 cfu/mL (IQR 2-42) with a ratio of 1.3 bacteria/cell (IQR 0.6-2.5). The median count of intracellular bacteria in 24 patients with severe disease was 46 bacteria/cell (IQR 9-105) compared with 6.5 bacteria/cell (IQR 2-34) in 143 with non-severe disease (p=0.005). The intracellular BMC count was negatively correlated with the peripheral white cell count and positively correlated with hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, aspartate transaminase, a positive BC and the fever clearance time following treatment with azithromycin, ofloxacin or a combination of the two. CONCLUSIONS: BMC gave a moderate additional yield over BC. Intracellular BMC counts may reflect the bacterial load in typhoid fever.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Persons living with human immunodeficiency virus are an underserved population for evidence-based cancer treatment. Paclitaxel and carboplatin (PCb) is an active regimen against a variety of solid tumors, including several seen in excess in patients with HIV infection. We performed a pilot trial to evaluate the safety of full-dose PCb in people living with human immunodeficiency virus and cancer. METHODS: Eligible patients, stratified by concurrent antiretroviral therapy (ART) that included CYP3A4 inhibitors or not, received paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) in combination with carboplatin (target AUC 6) intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles. RESULTS: Sixteen evaluable patients received 64 cycles of PCb, including 6 patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibiting ART (ritonavir). The adverse event profile was consistent with the known toxicity profile of PCb, with no differences between the 2 strata. There were 4 partial responses (25%, 95% CI: 7%-52%), and overall, CD4+ lymphocyte count was similar after completion of therapy (median: 310/μL) compared with baseline values (median: 389/μL). Pharmacokinetic studies in 6 patients revealed no significant differences in Cmax or AUCinf for paclitaxel between the 2 cohorts. CONCLUSION: Full doses of PCb chemotherapy are tolerable when given concurrently with ART in people living with human immunodeficiency virus with cancer, including patients receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors.

      <td>PURPOSE: To describe a case of increased viral load in a patient with HIV-1 infection receiving treatment with crushed bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/FTC/TAF). SUMMARY: A 43-year-old man, newly diagnosed with HIV, was hospitalized due to failure to thrive, neurological changes, and hypotension. Before treatment, the HIV viral load (VL) was 769,704 copies/mL and the CD4+ T-cell count was 36 cells/μL. On hospital day (HD) 8, B/FTC/TAF by mouth daily was initiated. During the hospitalization, the patient's course was complicated by opportunistic infections, bilateral pneumothorax, seizure activity, and acute respiratory distress, requiring multiple intubations and extended time in the intensive care unit. A repeat VL measurement on HD 28 was 5,887 copies/mL after the patient had received 14 of 20 scheduled B/FTC/TAF doses. Because of a failed swallow study and continued nutritional deficits, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed on HD 38 and continuous tube feeds via the PEG tube were initiated. Subsequently, the B/FTC/TAF order was modified to be crushed, mixed in 30 mL water, and administered daily via the PEG tube. A repeat VL measurement on HD 65 showed an increase to 8,047 copies/mL, despite receipt of 37 consecutive doses of B/FTC/TAF. B/FTC/TAF was discontinued and dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily, darunavir 800 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg (DRV/r), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/FTC 300 mg/200 mg were started due to virological increase, need for a viable option compatible with PEG tube delivery, and potential for integrase inhibitor resistance. At the time of regimen change (HD 67), a resistance panel showed minor mutations, E157Q and V118I. The regimen was streamlined with discontinuation of DRV/r on HD 92. The patient was discharged on HD 161. The PEG tube was removed 2 months after discharge, oral B/FTC/TAF was reinitiated, and the patient was virologically suppressed at 1 year after discharge. CONCLUSION: Controlled studies are needed to verify acceptable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic metrics for crushed B/FTC/TAF given via tube, with and without tube feeds, before use in this manner.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this survey was to identify areas where doctors have divergent practices in pharmacological treatment for hyperactive delirium in terminally ill patients with cancer. METHODS: We conducted a survey of Japanese palliative care physicians and liaison psychiatrists. Inquiries were made regarding: (i) choice of drug class in the first-line treatment, (ii) administration methods of the first-line antipsychotic treatment, (iii) starting dose of antipsychotics in the first line treatment and maximum dose of antipsychotics in refractory delirium, and (iv) choice of treatment when the first-line haloperidol treatment failed. Respondents used a five-point Likert scale. RESULTS: Regarding choice of drug class in the first-line treatment, more doctors reported that they 'frequently' or 'very frequently' use antipsychotics only than antipsychotics and benzodiazepine (oral: 73.4 vs. 12.2%; injection: 61.3 vs. 11.6%, respectively). Regarding administration methods of the first-line antipsychotic treatment, the percentage of doctors who reported that they used antipsychotics as needed and around the clock were 55.4 and 68.8% (oral), 49.2 and 45.4% (injection), respectively. There were different opinions on the maximum dose of antipsychotics in refractory delirium. Regarding the choice of treatment when the first-line haloperidol treatment failed, the percentage of doctors who reported that they increased the dose of haloperidol, used haloperidol and benzodiazepines, and switched to chlorpromazine were 47.0, 32.1 and 16.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors have divergent practices in administration methods of the first-line antipsychotic treatment, maximum dose of antipsychotics, and choice of treatment when the first-line haloperidol treatment failed. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal treatment.</td>

      <td>Tuberculosis (TB) is major public health concern and Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) helps to prevent TB development among patients living with human immune deficiency virus (PLWHIV). However, the evidence is limited especially in the study area. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with TB among IPT users and non-IPT users of PLWHIV in Dessie, Ethiopia. A comparative cross-sectional study was employed for1 month in Dessie. A total of 326 respondents were selected using systematic random sampling. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were computed to identify factors associated with Tuberculosis. In multivariable analysis, AOR with 95% CI was used to declare statistically significant variables with TB. The prevalence of TB among non-IPT users was 48.5%, (95% CI 40.8-56.2%), and among IPT users was 8%, (95% CI 5-13%). Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis therapy (CPT) (AOR = 5.835, 95% CI 2.565-13.274), IPT (AOR = 10.359, 95% CI 4.054-26.472), ART adherence (AOR = 30.542, 95% CI 12.871-72.475), and believing that IPT use prevents TB (AOR = 0.093, 95% CI 0.018-0.484) were statistically significant factors. The prevalence of TB was higher among non-IPT users than among IPT users. Therefore, efforts should be strengthened to implement widespread use of IPT among adult PLWHIV.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Trichoderma spp. are filamentous fungi causing invasive fungal diseases in patients with haematological malignancies and in peritoneal dialysis patients. OBJECTIVES: To analyse clinical presentation, predisposing factors, treatment and outcome of Trichoderma infections. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted for published cases of invasive Trichoderma infection in PubMed until December 2021 and by reviewing the included studies' references. Cases from the FungiScope® registry were added to a combined analysis. RESULTS: We identified 50 invasive infections due to Trichoderma species, including 11 in the FungiScope® registry. The main underlying conditions were haematological malignancies in 19 and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in 10 cases. The most prevalent infection sites were lung (42%) and peritoneum (22%). Systemic antifungal therapy was administered in 42 cases (84%), mostly amphotericin B (n = 27, lipid-based formulation 13/27) and voriconazole in 15 cases (30%). Surgical interventions were performed in 13 cases (26%). Overall mortality was 48% (n = 24) and highest for allogeneic HSCT and solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients [80% (4/5) and 77% (7/9), respectively]. In patients treated with amphotericin B, voriconazole and caspofungin, mortality was 55% (15/27), 46% (7/15) and 28% (2/7), respectively. Three out of four patients treated with a combination therapy of voriconazole and caspofungin survived. CONCLUSIONS: Despite treatment with antifungal therapies and surgery, invasive Trichoderma infections are life-threatening complications in immunocompromised patients, especially after HSCT and SOT. In addition, Trichoderma spp. mainly affect the lungs in patients with haematological malignancies and the peritoneum in CAPD patients.</td>

METHODS: DREaM was an open-label, delayed-start, randomized, multipart trial consisting of: Part I, 2-month oral run-in; Part II, 9-month disease progression phase (PP or OAP); and Part III, 9 months of additional treatment (PP/PP; OAP re-randomized: OAP/OAP or OAP/PP). PP/PP and OAP/OAP comprised the 18-month extended disease progression (EDP) analysis. RESULTS: In Part II (PP, n = 78; OAP, n = 157), similar proportions of participants experienced a major treatment failure across groups (PP: 12.8 %; OAP: 13.4 %); no difference in time to first major treatment failure was identified (P = 0.918). Significant differences favoring PP emerged after 9 months; in Part III, no participants in the PP/PP group, 3.5 % of participants in the OAP/PP group, and 15.9 % in the OAP/OAP group experienced a major treatment failure (P = 0.002). In the EDP analysis, 10.2 % (PP/PP) and 25.4 % (OAP/OAP) of participants experienced a major treatment failure (P = 0.045; number needed to treat = 6). Safety results were similar between groups and consistent with the known safety profile of PP in adults with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of PP during the early stages of schizophrenia spectrum disorders significantly delayed time to hospitalization and arrest/incarceration, outcomes with important personal and economic consequences, compared with OAP during this 18-month study.

METHODS: EPICOS is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted in Spain, Bolivia, and Venezuela. Healthcare workers with negative SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG test were randomly assigned to: daily TDF/FTC plus HCQ for 12 weeks, TDF/FTC plus HCQ placebo, HCQ plus TDF/FTC placebo and TDF/FTC placebo plus HCQ placebo. Randomization was performed in groups of four. Primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19. We also studied any (symptomatic or asymptomatic) COVID-19. We compared group-specific 14-week risks via differences and ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Of 1002 individuals screened, 926 (92.4%) were eligible and there were 14 cases of symptomatic COVID-19: 220 were assigned to the TDF/FTC plus HCQ group (3 cases), 231 to the TDF/FTC placebo plus HCQ group (3 cases), 233 to the TDF/FTC plus HCQ placebo group (3 cases), and 223 to the double placebo group (5 cases). Compared with the double placebo group, 14-week risk ratios (95% CI) of symptomatic COVID-19 were 0.39 (0.00, 1.98) for TDF+HCQ, 0.34 (0.00, 2.06) for TDF, and 0.49 (0.00, 2.29) for HCQ. Corresponding risk ratios of any COVID-19 were 0.51 (0.21, 1.00) for TDF+HCQ, 0.81 (0.44, 1.49) for TDF, and 0.73 (0.41, 1.38) for HCQ. Adverse events were generally mild.

The participants diagnosed with PV of any gender aged between 18 and 60 years were randomized into the test group (n = 37) to receive oral IHA (10g/day) and topical HK and the active control group (n = 35) to receive oral Itraconazole (100 mg/day) and local Terbinafine (1%) for the period of 6 weeks. Of them, 30 participants in each group completed the duration of the protocol therapy. The outcome of this study was based on a per-protocol analysis of the data. The efficacy of the interventions was measured by post-treatment change in subjective clinical symptoms/signs, mean TSSS, IGA score, direct microscopy of fungal elements and DLQI. The dermal safety was assessed by Berger/Bowman Scoring Scale and systemic safety was evaluated by Urinalysis, haematological and biochemical parameters. RESULTS: This study observed statistically and clinically significant post-treatment reduction in itching (test group vs. active control group; 73.4% vs. 89.1%), hypopigmentation (63.2% vs. 57.1%), hyperpigmentation (60% vs. 65.5%), and scaling (91.6% vs. 92.7%) (p &lt; 0.001). The differences in mean TSSS (5.4 ± 0.63 vs. 5.60 ± 0.32), IGA score (2.07 ± 0.15 vs. 1.74 ± 0.08) and DLQI (9.6 ± 2.06 vs. 9.04 ± 2.7) were also found clinically and statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001) in each group when compared baseline data to post-treatment. On inter-group comparison, the changes in mean TSSS and DLQI were not found statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05. But, the change in the mean IGA score was significant (p = 0.03). Further, the mycological cure was observed in 100% and 76.7% of participants in the test group and the control group respectively. On comparing inter-group the effects of the interventions on direct microscopy were found statistically significant (p = 0.034). In addition, no significant change in urinalysis, biochemical and haematological parameters from baseline to post-treatment in each group was observed. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that the test drugs (IHA and HK) were safe and effective in the treatment of PV. The oral (IHA) and local (HK) Unani formulations were tolerated well by all the participants The efficacy and safety of the IHA and HK were comparable to the standard drugs (Itraconazole and Terbinafine).</td>

      <td>In this study, we describe a case report of gonococcal arthritis in a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus patient. Although several mechanisms favor disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) in patients immunosuppressed by SLE, this association is rarely reported in literature. We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the etiologic agent involved and molecular analysis using a global collection of N. gonorrhoeae strains. Ours is the only sample derived from synovial fluid identified in this collection, the others being from the usual anatomical sites. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion and Etest, and WGS was conducted to determine multilocus sequence typing profiles, group isolates based on core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), and identify virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance determinants. The N. gonorrhoeae samples in the global collection were highly heterogeneous. The SNP tree had a total 19532 SNPs in 320 samples. Our sample displayed resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC = 2 μg/mL) and tetracycline (zone diameter = 0 mm) belonged to ST 1588 and was not closely related to any isolate in the global collection of N. gonorrhoeae strains. The isolate had genetic features related to beta-lactam, tetracycline and quinolone resistance. Seventy-one virulence genes were identified in our sample, belonging to the following classes: adherence, efflux pump, immune modulator, invasion, iron uptake, protease and stress adaptation. Moreover, no virulence genes for immune evasion and toxin were identified.</td>

      <td>Identification of potentially irritating intravenous medications</td>
      <td>AIMS: To identify commonly used intravenous drugs that may produce endothelial damage. METHODS: An experimental research study was performed using a sample of 62 intravenous drugs commonly used in emergency care, pH and osmolarity were measured. Subsequently, based on these values, the theoretical capacity to cause irritation or endovascular damage was determined and classified as high, moderate, and low. RESULTS: Samples from 19 drugs for fluid therapy, 21 antibiotics and 22 drugs for intravenous use were studied. Glucose solutions, sodium bicarbonate 1M and mannitol 10% showed a high capacity to cause venous irritation. Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, amiodarone, haloperidol, and labetalol solution presented a high capacity for irritation based on their acidic pH. The antibiotics, dexketoprofen, diazepam, digoxin, etomidate, phenytoin, levetiracetam and metamizole also showed high osmotic values in their reconstituted or undiluted presentations. Moreover, osmolarity of diazepam, digoxin and phenytoin remained high despite being diluted in 100 ml of saline. CONCLUSIONS: Knowing the pH and osmolarity of intravenous drugs allows their capacity to cause endothelial damage to be assessed. The use of comprehensive tables based on the chemical properties of the drugs can be a useful tool to help prevent chemically-induced phlebitis.</td>

      <td>Histamine promotes adhesion of neutrophils by inhibition of autophagy in dairy cows with subacute ruminal acidosis</td>
      <td>Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA), a common digestive disease in dairy cows, is accompanied by systemic inflammation and high concentrations of histamine in blood. Histamine-induced neutrophil adhesion may play an important role in the systemic inflammation experienced by cows during SARA. Autophagy, an intracellular degradation system, regulates recycling of membrane-associated integrin and may be involved in histamine-induced adhesion of bovine neutrophils. In the present study, 20 multiparous mid-lactation cows (average body weight 486 ± 24 kg) fitted with ruminal fistula were assigned to a control group (n = 10) or a SARA group (n = 10). We induced SARA by feeding different combinations of wheat-barley pellets and chopped alfalfa hay for 8 wk; SARA was defined as a ruminal pH &lt;5.6 for at least 3 h/d. Blood samples were collected in wk 8. Compared with controls, SARA cows had greater serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, IL-1β, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein, haptoglobin, and serum amyloid A. Serum concentrations of these proinflammatory factors had strong positive correlations with the concentration of serum histamine and LPS. In ex vivo adhesion experiments, the number of adherent neutrophils was greater in the SARA group. Additionally, membrane protein abundance of adhesion molecules such as integrin α-L precursor (CD11a) and integrin α-M precursor (CD11b) was greater in neutrophils of the SARA group, confirming enhanced adhesion ability. Neutrophils of SARA cows had greater number of autophagosomes, greater protein abundance of autophagy substrate sequestosome-1 (p62), and higher ratio of microtubule associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3)-II to LC3-I, indicating congestion during the late phase of autophagy flux. For in vitro experiments, neutrophils isolated from control cows were incubated with 0.4 endotoxin units (EU)/mL LPS or 7 μM histamine for 0, 1, 2, and 4 h, respectively. We detected linear and quadratic effects for the number of adherent neutrophils after histamine treatment with a peak response at 2 h, whereas no significant effect was detected after LPS treatment. Membrane protein abundance of CD11a and CD11b was greater after histamine treatment, suggesting that it may have an inhibitory effect on the degradation of adhesion molecules. The greater abundance of p62, higher ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I, and increased co-localization between CD11b and LC3 after histamine treatment indicated that recycling of adhesion molecules and autophagy flux were blocked. These effects were not aggravated further in the presence of chloroquine, a specific inhibitor of the late phase of autophagy flux. Overall, our results revealed that histamine increases adhesion of neutrophils by inhibiting autophagy in dairy cows with SARA.</td>

      <td>Update on Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia</td>
      <td>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recently published evidence relevant to Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB). RECENT FINDINGS: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen causing co-infections and superinfections in patients with COVID-19. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia ratios have sharply risen during the pandemic. SAB mortality is 18% at 1 month and 27% at 3 months but has gradually decreased over the last 30 years. Recurrences and reinfections are common (9%). Standardised items to define complicated SAB, and a new cut-off defining persisting bacteremia after 2 days with positive blood cultures have been proposed. Multiple antibiotic combinations have been trialled including vancomycin or daptomycin with β-lactams, fosfomycin, or clindamycin, without significant results. In the recently published guidelines, vancomycin remains the first line of treatment for MRSA bacteremia. For the management of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, cefazolin less frequently causes acute kidney injury than flucloxacillin, and when susceptibility is demonstrated, de-escalation to penicillin G is suggested. SUMMARY: Our review confirms that Staphylococcus aureus represents a special aetiology among all causes of bloodstream infections. Pending results of platform and larger trials, its distinct epidemiology and determinants mandate careful integration of clinical variables and best available evidence to optimize patient outcomes.</td>

      <td>Umbelliferae plants, which are widely used as traditional Chinese medicine because of their characteristics of relieving rheumatism, alleviating fever, circulating blood and easing pain. This experimental study was based on ear edema model caused by 12-O-tetracycline-propylphenol-13-acetic acid (TPA) in mice and compared with the Ibuprofen (Ib) group. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyse the composition of the essential oils from the four studied Umbelliferae plants (Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, A. dahurica (Hoffm.) Benth. &amp; Hook.f. ex Franch. &amp; Sav., A. pubescens Maxim and Foeniculum vulgare Mill.). Biologically active components in volatile oils from the four studied Umbelliferae plants were evaluated. The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and RelA (p65) in mouse skin were determined by immunohistochemical method. The refractive index of the four essential oils was calculated. A total of 239 compounds were identified by GC-MS from the four studied plants, and the main constituents were osthole (44.61%, APEOs), obepin (0.59%, APEOs &amp; 86.58%, FVEOs), undecanol (8.58%, ADEOs), α-muurolene (7.95%, ADEOs) and cis-anethol (9.11%, ADEOs). E-ligustilide (0.14%, APEOs &amp; 81.14%, ASEOs), (-)-spathulenol (0.08%, FVEOs &amp; 1.21%, ASEOs), (-)-terpinen-4-ol (4.91%, FVEOs), 2-butylthiolane (5.76%, APEOs) and α-bisabolol (3.80%, APEOs). This study showed that all the essential oils from the four studied Umbelliferae plants contained various lactones, including ligustrongolactone, trans-anisol and imperatorin. According to the results of the TPA induction test in the mouse ear edema model, the essential oils of four Umbelliferae plants reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, COX-2, IL-6 and p65. All of them showed extraordinary biological activity in anti-inflammatory, so they have potential application value for biomedical products, pharmaceutical preparations, natural functional nutrients and cosmetic additives.</td>

      <td>Contrasting Effect of Salts on the Binding of Antimalarial Drug Hydroxychloroquine with Different Sequences of Duplex DNA</td>
      <td>Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an important antimalarial drug which functions plausibly by targeting the DNA of parasites. Salts play a crucial role in the functionality of various biological processes. Hence, the effect of salts (NaCl and MgCl2) on the binding of HCQ with AT- and CG-DNAs as well as the binding-induced stability of both sequences of DNAs have been investigated using the spectroscopic and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods. It has been found that the effect of salts on the binding of HCQ is highly sensitive to the nature of ions as well as DNA sequences. The effect of ions is opposite for the binding of AT- and CG-DNAs as the presence of Mg2+ ions enhances the binding of HCQ with AT-DNA, whereas the binding of HCQ with CG-DNA gets decreased on the addition of both ions. Similarly, the presence of Mg2+ enhances the stabilization of HCQ-bound AT-DNA, whereas the effect is opposite for the CG-DNA in the presence of both the ions. The MD simulation study suggests that the hydration states of both ions are different and they interact differently in the minor and major grooves of both the sequences of DNA which may be one of the reasons for the different binding of HCQ with these two sequences of DNA in the presence of salts. The information about the effect of salts on the binding of HCQ with DNAs in a sequence-specific manner may be useful in understanding the mechanism of the action and toxicity effect of HCQ against malaria.</td>

      <td>TBI-166, derived from riminophenazine analogues, shows more potent anti-TB activity than clofazimine and is being assessed against tuberculosis (TB) in a phase IIa clinical trial in China. Preclinical regimen studies containing TBI-166 will support the phase IIb clinical trials of TBI-166. In the present study, we compared the efficacy in three murine TB models of an all-oral drug-resistant TB drug regimen of TBI-166 with bedaquiline (BDQ) and pyrazinamide (PZA) with the first-line regimen of isoniazid (INH) with rifampin (RFP) and PZA (HRZ regimen), the most effective reported TBI-166-containing regimen of TBI-166 with BDQ and linezolid (LZD), and the Nix-TB clinical trial regimen of BDQ with pretomanid and LZD (BPaL regimen). In the C3HeB/FeJ murine TB model, for the TBI-166+BDQ+PZA regimen, the lungs of mice were culture negative at 4 weeks, and there were no relapses at 8 weeks of treatment. The reduction in bacterial burden and relapse rate were greater than those of the HRZ regimen and the TBI-166+BDQ+LZD regimen. Compared with the BPaL regimen, the TBI-166+BDQ+PZA regimen had similar or stronger early bactericidal activity, bactericidal activity, and sterilizing activity in the BALB/c murine TB model. The bacterial burden in the TBI-166+BDQ+PZA regimen group decreased significantly more than that in the BPaL regimen group and was almost or totally relapse free (&lt;13.33% after 8 weeks). In conclusion, oral short-course three-drug regimens, including TBI-166 with high efficacy, were identified. The TBI-166+BDQ+PZA regimen is recommended for further study in a TBI-166 phase IIb clinical trial.</td>

      <td>Tracking the Transmission of Antimicrobial-Resistant Non-O157 Escherichia coli and Salmonella Isolates at the Interface of Food Animals and Fresh Produce from Agriculture Operations Using Whole-Genome Sequencing</td>
      <td>An increasing number of outbreaks are caused by foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella, which often harbor antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. We previously demonstrated the transmission of pathogens from animal operations to produce fields on sustainable farms, which illustrated an urgent need to develop and implement novel prevention methods and remediation practices such as the vegetative buffer zone (VBZ) to prevent this movement. The focus of this study was to use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize the AMR, virulence, and single-nucleotide polymorphism profile of 15 Salmonella and 128 E. coli isolates collected from small-scale dairy and poultry farms on a research station in North Carolina. Phenotypically, seven E. coli and three Salmonella isolates displayed resistance to antibiotics such as tetracycline (n = 4), ampicillin (n = 4), nalidixic acid (n = 3), chloramphenicol (n = 2), sulfisoxazole (n = 1), and streptomycin (n = 1). A single E. coli isolate was found to be resistant to five different antibiotic class types and possessed the blaTEM-150 resistance gene. Virulence genes that facilitate toxin production and cell invasion were identified. Mauve analysis of the E. coli isolates identified seven clusters (dairy-six and poultry-one) indicating that transmission is occurring from animal operations to fresh produce fields and the surrounding environment when the VBZ is denudated. This suggests that the VBZ is a useful barrier to reducing the transmission of enteric pathogens in agricultural systems. Our study demonstrates the prevalence of AMR and virulence genes on small-scale sustainable farms and highlights the advantage of using WGS to assess the impact of the VBZ to reduce the transmission of E. coli and Salmonella.</td>

      <td>Geriatric risk and protective factors for serious COVID-19 outcomes among older adults in Shanghai Omicron wave</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Omicron variant was featured with high transmissibility and striking antibody evasion. Shanghai has been experiencing Omicron wave since March 2022. Though several studies have evaluated the risk factors of severe infections, the analyses of BA.2 infection risk and protective factors among geriatric people was much limited. METHODS: This multicenter cohort study described clinical characteristics of geriatric Omicron infections (aged more than 60), and assessed risk and protective factors for severe infections. RESULTS: A total of 1377 patients older than 60 were enrolled, with 75.96% had comorbidities. The median viral shedding time and hospitalization time was 9 and 8 days, respectively. Severe/critical were associated with longer virus clearance time (aOR [95%CI]:0.706(0.533-0.935), P=0.015)), while fully vaccinated/booster and paxlovid use shortened viral shedding time (1.229 [1.076-1.402], P=0.002; 1.140 [.019-1.274], P=0.022, respectively). Older age (&gt;80), cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease were risk factors of progressing to severe/critical. Fully vaccination was a significant protective factor of severe infections (0.237[0.071-0.793], P=0.019). Further, we found patients with more than two comorbidities were more likely to get serious outcome in all age groups. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that in the elderly older than 60 years old, older age (aged over 80), cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease were risk factors of severe infection. Patients with more than two comorbidities were more likely to get serious outcome. Fully vaccinated/booster patients were less likely to be severe and vaccinations could shorten viral shedding time. The limitation of lacking overall spectrum of COVID-19 infections among elders could be compensated in other larger scale studies in the future.</td>

      <td>Carbapenems are recommended for the treatment of urosepsis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing, multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli; however, due to selection of carbapenem resistance, there is an increasing interest in alternative treatment regimens including the use of β-lactam-aminoglycoside combinations. We compared the pharmacodynamic activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin as mono and combination therapy versus meropenem monotherapy against extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing, piperacillin-tazobactam resistant E. coli using a dynamic hollow fiber infection model (HFIM) over 7 days. Broth-microdilution was performed to determine the MIC of E. coli isolates. Whole genome sequencing was conducted. Four E. coli isolates were tested in HFIM with an initial inoculum of ~107 CFU/mL. Dosing regimens tested were piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g, 6-hourly, plus amikacin 30 mg/kg, 24-hourly, as combination therapy, and piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g, 6-hourly, amikacin 30 mg/kg, 24-hourly, and meropenem 1 g, 8-hourly, each as monotherapy. We observed that piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin monotherapy demonstrated initial rapid bacterial killing but then led to amplification of resistant subpopulations. The piperacillin-tazobactam/amikacin combination and meropenem experiments both attained a rapid bacterial killing (~4-5 log10) within 24 h and did not result in any emergence of resistant subpopulations. Genome sequencing demonstrated that all ESBL-producing E. coli clinical isolates carried multiple antibiotic resistance genes including blaCTX-M-15, blaOXA-1, blaEC, blaTEM-1, and aac(6')-Ib-cr. These results suggest that the combination of piperacillin-tazobactam/amikacin may have a potential role as a carbapenem-sparing regimen, which should be tested in future urosepsis clinical trials.</td>

      <td>Robust, Automated Analysis of Electrophysiology in Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Micro-Heart Muscle for Drug Toxicity</td>
      <td>Drugs are often removed from clinical trials or market progression owing to their unforeseen effects on cardiac action potential and calcium handling. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and tissues fabricated from these cells are promising as screening tools for early identification of these potential cardiac liabilities. In this study, we describe an automated, open-source MATLAB-based analysis software for calculating cardiac action potentials and calcium transients from fluorescent reporters. We first identified the most robust manner in which to automatically identify the initiation point for action potentials and calcium transients in a user-independent manner, and used this approach to quantify the duration and morphology of these signals. We then demonstrate the software by assessing changes to action potentials and calcium transients in our micro-heart muscles after exposure to hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug with known cardiac liability. Consistent with clinical observations, our system predicted mild action potential prolongation. However, we also observed marked calcium transient suppression, highlighting the advantage of testing multiple physiologic readouts in cardiomyocytes rather than relying on heterologous overexpression of single channels such as the human ether-a-go-go-related gene channel. This open-source software can serve as a useful, high-throughput tool for analyzing cardiomyocyte physiology from fluorescence imaging. Impact statement This article describes an open-source code that will allow researchers to assess changes in cardiac action potentials and calcium transients from fluorescent reporters in a fully automated manner. Automated analysis will allow researchers to increase the throughput of their experiments and grant greater insight into cardiac electrophysiology. Here, the usefulness of these pipelines is demonstrated through analysis of the effects of hydroxychloroquine.</td>

      <td>In this paper is reported the selective colorimetric detection and quantification of carbidopa, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, in the co-presence of levodopa as dopamine precursor in pharmaceutical formulations for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The method is based on the selective condensation reaction between the hydrazine group from carbidopa and the formyl functional group of vanillin, a natural flavoring agent, in acidified alcoholic solution. The yellow color development (λmax ~ 420 nm) due to the formation of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldazine (HMOB) was observed for carbidopa only, whereas levodopa, lacking the hydrazine group, did not color the solution, as expected. The calibration curves for two tablet formulations of levodopa in combination with carbidopa (4:1) were superimposable with levodopa/carbidopa (4:1), as well as carbidopa alone, in standard solution, i.e., the excipients and additives did not interfere with carbidopa determination, corresponding to a mean recovery about 105%. The linear dynamic range was between 5.00 and 50.0 mg L-1 with very good reproducibility within this range (CVav% about 3-4%) and very good sensitivity, with limits of quantification of about 1 mg L-1. The colorimetric method developed here is very simple, inexpensive, and effective for drug estimation and quality control of pharmaceutical formulations.</td>

      <td>Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of quinoxaline bearing tetrahydropyridine derivatives as anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-tubercular agents</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Quinoxaline and Tetrahydropyridine derivatives showed various biological properties. The combination of these two scaffolds may contribute to good biological activity and may give novel and efficacious bioactive candidates. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to identify bioactive agents with quinoxaline bearing tetrahydropyridine derivatives possessing anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-tubercular agents. METHOD: A series of novel quinoxaline bearing tetrahydropyridine derivatives have been designed and synthesized in good yields. The synthetic protocol involves three-component Povarov reactions of 6-amino quinoxaline, propenyl guaethol, and substituted aldehydes using BF3•OEt2 as catalyst. The newly synthesized molecules were evaluated for their anticancer activity against four cell lines, i.e. A-549, MCF-7, PC-3, and HepG2. RESULTS: The results from in vitro assay indicated that compound 4a proved to be as potent as the standard drug adriamycin against all cell lines with GI50 values &lt;10 μg/ml. Compounds 4b, 4f, and 4i exhibited good cytotoxicity against A-549 cell line. All synthesized molecules were evaluated for their antioxidant activity and the results revealed that the compounds 4a, 4b, and 4i showed promising antioxidant activities against DPPH and H2O2 scavenging. In addition, the anti-mycobacterial activity of the synthesized compounds against MTB H37Rv strain was determined using MABA method. The results indicate that the compounds 4a, 4b, 4g, and 4i showed better anti-mycobacterial activity than the standard drugs pyrazinamide, ciprofloxacin and streptomycin with MIC value 1.6 μg/ml. Furthermore, molecular docking studies and ADME properties showed good pharmacokinetic profile and drug-likeness properties. CONCLUSION: These studies showed that a series of novel quinoxaline bearing tetrahydropyridine derivatives exhibit anticancer, anti-mycobacterial, and antioxidant activities.</td>

      <td>A Review of Clinical Efficacy Data Supporting Emergency Use Authorization for COVID-19 Therapeutics and Lessons for Future Pandemics</td>
      <td>Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) allows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expedite the availability of therapeutics in the context of a public health emergency. To date, an evidentiary standard for clinical efficacy to support an EUA has not yet been established. This review examines the clinical data submitted in support of EUA for anti-viral and anti-inflammatory therapeutics for COVID-19 through December of 2021 and the resilience of the authorization as new clinical data arose subsequent to the authorization. In the vast majority of cases, EUA was supported by at least one well powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) where statistically significant efficacy was demonstrated. This included branded medications already approved for use outside of the context of COVID-19. When employed, the standard of a single RCT seemed to provide adequate evidence of clinical efficacy such that subsequent clinical studies generally supported or expanded the EUA of the therapeutic in question. The lone generic agent that was granted EUA (Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine) was not supported by a well-controlled RCT, and the EUA was withdrawn within three months time. This highlighted not only the ambiguity of the EUA standard, but also the need to provide avenues through which high quality clinical evidence for the efficacy of a generic medication could be obtained. Therefore, maintaining the clinical trial networks assembled during the COVID-19 pandemic could be a critical component of our preparation for future pandemics. Consideration could also be given to establishing a single successful RCT as regulatory guidance for obtaining an EUA.</td>

      <td>Risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in the community</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the risk of HCQ retinopathy and its risk factors among incident users in the community. METHODS: Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project, a record-linkage system, a cohort of incident users of HCQ was identified from 27 counties in the American upper Midwest. HCQ retinopathy was defined based on characteristic paracentral automated 10-2 visual field (10-2 AVF) defects and parafoveal retinal photoreceptor layer changes on spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Cumulative incidence rates were estimated adjusting for competing risk of death. Risk factors for HCQ retinopathy were examined using Cox models. RESULTS: The study included 634 incident HCQ users (mean age at initial HCQ use was 53.7 years, 79% females, 91% white). Most common indications for HCQ were RA (57%) and SLE (19%). The average follow-up length was 7.6 years. Eleven patients developed HCQ retinopathy (91% females, 91% white). The majority used HCQ for RA (91%). The cumulative incidence rate at year 5 was 0%, which increased to 3.9% (95% CI 2.0, 7.4) by 10 years. Taking an HCQ dose ≥5 mg/kg was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.59 (95% CI 1.09, 11.84) compared with lower doses. There was a 48% increase [HR 1.48 (95% CI 1.03, 2.14)] in the risk of HCQ retinopathy for each 100 g of HCQ cumulative dose. CONCLUSION: The risk of HCQ retinopathy at 10 years of use is lower compared with previous prevalence-based estimations. A dose ≥5 mg/kg was associated with higher HCQ retinopathy risk.</td>

      <td>Aspergillus spp. osteoarticular infections are destructive opportunistic infections, while there is no clear consensus on their management. The purpose of this review is to investigate the current literature regarding Aspergillus spp. osteoarticular infections. An electronic search of the PubMed and Scopus databases was conducted considering studies that assessed osteoarticular infections from Aspergillus spp. We included only studies with biopsy proven documentation of positive cultures or histological findings for Aspergillus spp., and those with essential information for each case such as the anatomical location of the infection, the type of treatment (conservative, surgical, combination), the antifungal therapy, and the outcome. Overall, 148 studies from 1965 to 2021 including 186 patients were included in the review. One hundred and seven (57.5%) patients underwent surgical debridement in addition to antifungal therapy, while 79 (42.7%) patients were treated only conservatively. Complete infection resolution was reported in 107 (57.5%) patients, while partial resolution in 29 (15.5%) patients. Surgical debridement resulted in higher complete infection resolution rate compared to only antifungal therapy (70.0% vs. 40.5%, P &lt; 0.001), while complete resolution rate was similar for antifungal monotherapy and combination/sequential therapy (58.3% vs. 54.5%; P = 0.76). Last, complete resolution rate was also similar for monotherapy with amphotericin B (58.1%) and voriconazole (58.6%; P = 0.95). The results of this study indicate that antifungal monotherapy has similar efficacy with combination/sequential therapy, while voriconazole has similar efficacy with amphotericin B. Moreover, surgical debridement of the infected focus results in better outcomes in terms of infection eradication compared to conservative treatment. LAY SUMMARY: Antifungal monotherapy has similar efficacy with combination/sequential therapy, and voriconazole has similar efficacy with amphotericin B for the treatment of Aspergillus spp. osteoarticular infections, while surgical debridement of the infected focus improves the infection eradication rate.</td>

      <td>Bacterial Growth-Induced Tobramycin Smart Release Self-Healing Hydrogel for Pseudomonas aeruginosa-Infected Burn Wound Healing</td>
      <td>Burns are a common health problem worldwide and are highly susceptible to bacterial infections that are difficult to handle with ordinary wound dressings. Therefore, burn wound repair is extremely challenging in clinical practice. Herein, a series of self-healing hydrogels (QCS/OD/TOB/PPY@PDA) with good electrical conductivity and antioxidant activity were prepared on the basis of quaternized chitosan (QCS), oxidized dextran (OD), tobramycin (TOB), and polydopamine-coated polypyrrole nanowires (PPY@PDA NWs). These Schiff base cross-links between the aminoglycoside antibiotic TOB and OD enable TOB to be slowly released and responsive to pH. Interestingly, the acidic substances during the bacteria growth process can induce the on-demand release of TOB, avoiding the abuse of antibiotics. The antibacterial results showed that the QCS/OD/TOB/PPY@PDA9 hydrogel could kill high concentrations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli in a short time and showed a bactericidal effect for up to 11 days in an agar plate diffusion experiment, while showing good in vivo antibacterial activity. Excellent and long-lasting antibacterial properties make it suitable for severely infected wounds. Furthermore, the incorporation of PPY@PDA endowed the hydrogel with near-infrared (NIR) irradiation assisted bactericidal activity of drug-resistant bacteria, conductivity, and antioxidant activity. Most importantly, in the PA-infected burn wound model, the QCS/OD/TOB/PPY@PDA9 hydrogel more effectively controlled wound inflammation levels and promoted collagen deposition, vascular generation, and earlier wound closure compared to Tegaderm dressings. Therefore, the TOB smart release hydrogels with on-demand delivery are extremely advantageous for bacterial-infected burn wound healing.</td>

      <td>A Bioavailability Model to Predict the Impact of pH and Dissolved Organic Carbon on Ciprofloxacin Ecotoxicity to the Cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa</td>
      <td>Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is a pseudo-persistent antibiotic detected in freshwater worldwide. As an ionizable chemical, its fate in freshwater is influenced by water chemistry factors such as pH, hardness and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content. Here, we investigated the effect of pH, DOC and Ca2+ levels on the toxicity of CIP to Microcystis aeruginosa, and developed a bioavailability model on the basis of these experimental results. We found that the zwitterion (CIP+/- ) is the most bioavailable species of CIP to M. aeruginosa, whereas DOC is the most dominant factor reducing CIP toxicity, possibly via binding of both CIP+/- and CIP+ to DOC. pH likely also regulates the CIP-DOC binding indirectly through its influence on CIP speciation. In addition, higher tolerance to CIP by M. aeruginosa was observed at pH &lt; 7.2, but the underlying mechanism is yet unclear. Calcium was identified as an insignificant factor in CIP bioavailability. When parameterized with the data obtained from toxicity experiments, our bioavailability model is able to provide accurate predictions of CIP toxicity, as the observed and predicted total median effective concentration (EC50total ) deviated by less than 28% from each other. Our model predicts that changes in pH and DOC conditions can affect CIP toxicity by up to tenfold, suggesting that CIP in many natural environments is likely less toxic than in standard laboratory toxicity experiments.

Methods: The Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report was used in this study, and data were obtained from April 2004 to February 2021. Patients who received LAI-APs available in Japan (LAI haloperidol, LAI fluphenazine, LAI aripiprazole, LAI risperidone, and LAI paliperidone) or the equivalent O-APs were included in this study. We calculated the adjusted reporting odds ratios (aRORs) to compare the reporting frequency of TD. Results: A total of 8,425 patients were included in the study. TD was reported significantly less frequently with LAI paliperidone than with oral paliperidone (aROR [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.13 [0.05-0.36]). Other LAI-APs were associated with a numerically lower reporting frequency of TD than the equivalent oral SGAs. The reporting frequency of TD associated with LAI-SGAs was significantly lower than that of LAI-FGAs (aROR [95% CI] = 0.18 [0.08-0.43]). All LAI-SGAs were significantly associated with a lower reporting frequency of TD than that of LAI fluphenazine (aROR [95% CI]: LAI aripiprazole, 0.11 [0.04-0.35]; LAI risperidone, 0.09 [0.03-0.32]; LAI paliperidone, 0.02 [0.005-0.09]). and LAI haloperidol, 8.58 [1.85-39.72]). LAI fluphenazine was significantly associated with a higher reporting frequency of TD than LAI haloperidol (aROR [95% CI] = 8.58 [1.85-39.72]). The reporting frequency of TD associated with LAI paliperidone was significantly lower than that with LAI aripiprazole (aROR [95% CI] = 0.18 [0.05-0.73]). Conclusions: Compared to O-APs, LAI-APs, particularly LAI-SGAs, may be associated with a lower risk of TD.</td>

      <td>Pharmaceutical residues in the environment are of great concern as ubiquitous emerging contaminants. This study investigated the presence of 40 pharmaceuticals in water and sediment of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in the wet season of 2020. Among psychiatric drugs, only diazepam was found in water samples while six of them were detected in the sediment. The Σantibiotics levels ranged from 6.18 to 35.9 ng/L and 2.63 to 140 ng/g dry weight in water and sediment samples, respectively. Fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines were found well settling in the outlet sediment, while sulfonamides could be released from disturbed sediment under stronger tidal wash-out conditions. After entering the marine waters, pharmaceuticals tended to deposit at the PRE mouth by the influence of the plume bulge and onshore invasion of deep shelf waters. Low ecological risks to the aquatic organisms and of causing antimicrobial resistance were identified. Likewise, hydrological modeling results revealed insignificant risks: erythromycin-H2O and sulfamethoxazole discharged through the outlets constituted 30.8% and 6.74% of their environmental capacity, respectively. Source apportionment revealed that pharmaceutical discharges through the Humen and Yamen outlets were predominantly of animal origin. Overall, our findings provide strategic insights on environmental regulations to further minimize the environmental stress of pharmaceuticals in the PRE.</td>

      <td>New antimicrobial peptide-antibiotic combination strategy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa inactivation</td>
      <td>Novel antimicrobials or new treatment strategies are urgently needed to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) related infections and especially to address the problem of antibiotic resistance. We propose a novel strategy that combines the human antimicrobial peptide (AMP) LL37 with different antibiotics to find synergistic AMP-antibiotic combinations against P. aeruginosa strains in vitro. Our results showed that LL37 exhibited synergistic inhibitory and bactericidal effects against P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PA103 when combined with the antibiotics vancomycin, azithromycin, polymyxin B, and colistin. In addition, LL37 caused strong outer membrane permeabilization, as demonstrated through measurement of an increased uptake of the fluorescent probe N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine. The membrane permeabilization effects appear to explain why it was easier to rescue the effectiveness of the antibiotic toward the bacteria because the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa exhibits barrier function for antibiotics. Furthermore, the change in the zeta potential was measured for P. aeruginosa strains with the addition of LL37. Zeta potentials for P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PA103 were -40.9 and -10.9 mV, respectively. With the addition of LL37, negative zeta potentials were gradually neutralized. We found that positively charged LL37 can interact with and neutralize the negatively charged bacterial outer membrane through electrostatic interactions, and the process of neutralization is believed to have contributed to the increase in outer membrane permeability. Finally, to further illustrate the relationship between outer membrane permeabilization and the uptake of antibiotics, we used LL37 to make the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa strains more permeable, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for several antibiotics (colistin, gentamicin, polymyxin B, vancomycin, and azithromycin) were measured. The MICs decreased were twofold to fourfold, in general. For example, the MICs of azithromycin and vancomycin decreased more than fourfold when against P. aeruginosa strain PAO1, which were the greatest decrease of any of the antibiotics tested in this experiment. As for PA103, the MIC of polymyxin B2 decreased fourfold, which was the strongest decrease seen for any of the antibiotics tested in this experiment. The increased uptake of antibiotics not only demonstrates the barrier role of the outer membrane but also validates the mechanism of synergistic effects that we have proposed. These results indicate the great potential of an LL37-antibiotic combination strategy and provide possible explanations for the mechanisms behind this synergy.</td>

However, the development of daptomycin-resistant VREfm challenges the treatment of nosocomial VREfm infections. Resistance mechanisms of daptomycin are not fully understood. Here we analysed the genomic changes leading to a daptomycin-susceptible VREfm isolate becoming resistant after 50 days of daptomycin and linezolid combination therapy. Seven isogenic VREfm isolates from the same patient (daptomycin-susceptible and daptomycin-resistant) were analysed using Illumina whole genome sequencing, and two isolates were further characterised with Nanopore sequencing. One nonsynonymous SNP in the rpoC gene previously shown to harbour mutations in daptomycin-resistant VREfm was identified in the daptomycin-resistant isolates. Whole genome comparative analysis identified the loss of a 46.5 kb fragment, duplication of a 29.7 kb fragment, and integration of two plasmids upon acquisition of daptomycin resistance. Transmission electron microscopy showed similar alterations in cell morphology and cell wall structure as have previously been described in daptomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis.</td>

METHODS: The relationships of oral hygiene status (calculus index [CI], debris index [DI]), the mean number of decayed-missing-filled teeth (mean DMFT), and Revised Oral Assessment Guide (ROAG) with related factors (hospitalization, chlorpromazine equivalents [CPZE], age, Barthel Index [BI], frequency of cleaning teeth, and self-oral hygiene ability) among 249 hospitalized schizophrenic patients were investigated. RESULTS: The results for oral hygiene status were as follows: median (range); CI 0.5 (0-6.0), DI 1.7 (0-6.0), ROAG 10.0 (7.0-15.0); and mean DMFT 21.7±7.3. The average CPZE was 524.4±353.6 mg (mean ± SD), and the BI was 76.4±30.7. There was a negative correlation between BI and DI (r = -0.34) and a positive correlation between age and mean DMFT (r=0.57). Male patients tended to have worse oral conditions (ROAG) than females. The least-squares multiple regression analysis revealed that BI for DI, age for mean DMFT, sex for ROAG, and self-oral hygiene ability for CI, DI, and mean DMFT were factors related to oral health status. CONCLUSION: Patients with schizophrenia tended to have poor oral hygiene. BI, being male, and low activities of daily living were associated with poor oral hygiene. Furthermore, advanced age was associated with an increased risk of dental caries.</td>

      <td>ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Antiviral therapy can alleviate liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B, but it has a limited effect on advanced liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), particularly FuZheng HuaYu (FZHY) tablet, appears to have an antifibrotic effect, but its improving resolution of hepatitis b virus (HBV) -associated advanced fibrosis and experienced anti-viral treatment has not been investigated. AIM OF THE STUDY: To observe the safety and efficacy of adjunctive FZHY on the HBV-associated cirrhosis patients who received 2 years of entecavir but still with advanced fibrosis. METHODS: An open-label, multicentre, single arm trial. 251 patients were included and treated with TCM consisted of FZHY tablets 1.6 g and granules, three times a day in addition to entecavir 0.5 mg daily for an additional 48 weeks. Primary outcome was regression of fibrosis (the proportion of patients with a 1-point decrease in the Ishak liver fibrosis score from baseline to week 48). RESULTS: Fibrosis regression occurred in 94 of 184 patients with paired liver biopsy (51.09%, 95% CI: 43.9～58.0). In 132 compensated cirrhosis patients (Ishak score ≥5), 56.06% (74/132, 95% CI: 47.5～64.2) showed fibrosis regression and reached the goal of 54% (15% more than entecavir mono-therapy). 10 patients occurred adverse reaction, most of them were mild, and all recovered or achieved remission. CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy of FZHY, TCM granules and ETV could regress the liver fibrosis in the patients with HBV cirrhosis, who experienced 2 years of ETV treatment, and it is safe and well tolerated.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVES: The increase in multidrug-resistant bacteria has reached an alarming rate globally making it necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms mediating resistance in order to discover new therapeutics. Tigecycline (TGC), is a last-resort antimicrobial agent for the treatment of serious infections caused by extensively drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: The TGC resistant Escherichia coli mutants were obtained by exposing three different TGC susceptible isolates belonging to ST131 (n=2) and ST405 (n=1) to increasing concentrations of TGC. The genetic alterations associated with reduced susceptibility to TGC were identified using whole genome sequencing. The fitness cost of TGC resistance acquisition as well as incidence of cross-resistance was also investigated. RESULTS: The TGC MICs of in vitro selected mutants were elevated 8 to 32 times compared to ancestral strains. Inactivating mutations (frameshift and nonsense) or amino acid substitutions, were identified in genes encoding proteins with divers functions including AcrAB efflux pump or its regulators (lon, marR), LPS inner core biosynthesis enzymes (waaQ, eptB), ribosomal S9 protein (rpsI) and RNA polymerase β subunit. In most cases but not all, acquisition of TGC resistance was associated with a fitness cost. While TGC resistance development was associated with cross-resistance to other members of tetracycline family and chloramphenicol, hypersensitivity to nitrofurantoin was identified among heptose III-less LPS mutants. CONCLUSION: TGC resistance among the studied mutants was found to be multifactorial with extrusion by efflux transports being the most common mechanism. The LPS inner core biosynthesis pathway as well as ribosomal S9 protein could be additional targets for TGC resistance.</td>

METHODS: In this retrospective observational case series, microbiological records of all corneal ulcers were reviewed from 1991 to 2020 and assessed for trends in keratitis and antibiotic susceptibility using the χ2 test. RESULTS: Of the total of 51,747 patients, 51.13% were culture positive. A decrease in bacteria was noted from 56% to 38%, with a parallel increase in fungal isolates from 24% to 51%. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 70.8% of the total bacteria, a trend in rise of Streptococcus pneumoniae (31%) and a decreasing trend in prevalence of Staphylococcus epidermidis was observed over 30 years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (55.5%) was the most prevalent gram-negative pathogen, whereas Fusarium spp. (33.1%) and Aspergillus spp. (32.4%) were the most common fungal isolates. The susceptibility of gram-positive organisms to cefazolin decreased from 95.5% to 66% (P = 0.0001), amikacin from 88% to 55% (P= 0.0001), and vancomycin from 98.9% to 90.7% (P &lt; 0.05). A similar decrease in susceptibility was also significant for gram-negative organisms with piperacillin/tazobactam and chloramphenicol (P &lt; 0.05). A significant trend toward increasing resistance against fluoroquinolones was also observed for ciprofloxacin (gram-positive organisms: 16% to 50%; gram-negative organisms: 11.5% to 18.7%), gatifloxacin (38% to 47%), and moxifloxacin (9.4% to 29%). CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of keratitis has changed, and fungus is now the predominant etiology. An increasing trend in resistance to all antibiotics studied would affect the empiric treatment, also suggesting regular surveillance.</td>

      <td>Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention of Malaria in the US: A Review</td>
      <td>Importance: Malaria is caused by protozoa parasites of the genus Plasmodium and is diagnosed in approximately 2000 people in the US each year who have returned from visiting regions with endemic malaria. The mortality rate from malaria is approximately 0.3% in the US and 0.26% worldwide. Observations: In the US, most malaria is diagnosed in people who traveled to an endemic region. More than 80% of people diagnosed with malaria in the US acquired the infection in Africa. Of the approximately 2000 people diagnosed with malaria in the US in 2017, an estimated 82.4% were adults and about 78.6% were Black or African American. Among US residents diagnosed with malaria, 71.7% had not taken malaria chemoprophylaxis during travel. In 2017 in the US, P falciparum was the species diagnosed in approximately 79% of patients, whereas P vivax was diagnosed in an estimated 11.2% of patients. In 2017 in the US, severe malaria, defined as vital organ involvement including shock, pulmonary edema, significant bleeding, seizures, impaired consciousness, and laboratory abnormalities such as kidney impairment, acidosis, anemia, or high parasitemia, occurred in approximately 14% of patients, and an estimated 0.3% of those receiving a diagnosis of malaria in the US died. P falciparum has developed resistance to chloroquine in most regions of the world, including Africa. First-line therapy for P falciparum malaria in the US is combination therapy that includes artemisinin. If P falciparum was acquired in a known chloroquine-sensitive region such as Haiti, chloroquine remains an alternative option. When artemisinin-based combination therapies are not available, atovaquone-proguanil or quinine plus clindamycin is used for chloroquine-resistant malaria. P vivax, P ovale, P malariae, and P knowlesi are typically chloroquine sensitive, and treatment with either artemisinin-based combination therapy or chloroquine for regions with chloroquine-susceptible infections for uncomplicated malaria is recommended. For severe malaria, intravenous artesunate is first-line therapy. Treatment of mild malaria due to a chloroquine-resistant parasite consists of a combination therapy that includes artemisinin or chloroquine for chloroquine-sensitive malaria. P vivax and P ovale require additional therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline to eradicate the liver stage. Several options exist for chemoprophylaxis and selection should be based on patient characteristics and preferences. Conclusions and Relevance: Approximately 2000 cases of malaria are diagnosed each year in the US, most commonly in travelers returning from visiting endemic areas. Prevention and treatment of malaria depend on the species and the drug sensitivity of parasites from the region of acquisition. Intravenous artesunate is first-line therapy for severe malaria.</td>

      <td>Effectiveness and Tolerability of Lurasidone for Bipolar Types I and II and Other Specified Bipolar Depression: A 12-Week Observational Study</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: There are few guidelines on the management of depressive episodes in patients with bipolar type II (BDII) and related disorders (other specified bipolar and related disorders [OSBD]). Lurasidone is a potential option for treating depressive episodes in BDII/OSBD. This retrospective chart review study aimed to examine the effectiveness and tolerability of lurasidone for use in patients with bipolar depression. METHODS: We reviewed 66 consecutive outpatients with bipolar depression who were prescribed lurasidone between June 2020 and January 2021 and examined 12-week outcomes. Fourteen patients were diagnosed with BDI, and 52 patients were diagnosed with BDII/OSBD (42 BDII and 10 OSBD). Depressive symptoms were evaluated by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report (QIDS-SR) at baseline and 2, 4, and 12 weeks. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study period by the incidence of adverse events, such as akathisia, nausea, and manic/hypomanic switch, as well as the lurasidone dropout rate due to adverse events. RESULTS: The total QIDS-SR score at 2 (P &lt; 0.001), 4 (P &lt; 0.001), and 12 weeks (P &lt; 0.001) was significantly lower than that measured at baseline. Remission rate during study period was 29.1%. Of the 66 participants, 47 (71.2%) continued taking lurasidone and 27 (40.9%) and 16 (24.2%) reported adverse events and akathisia, respectively. No significant difference in total QIDS-SR score, dropout rate due to adverse events, rate of adverse events, or rate of akathisia was found between the BDII/OSBD and BDI groups. IMPLICATIONS: Lurasidone is tolerated and could be effective for managing depressive episodes in patients with BDII/OSBD and BDI.</td>

      <td>Sialidases are glycosyl hydrolase enzymes targeting the glycosidic bond between terminal sialic acids and underlying sugars. The NanH sialidase of Tannerella forsythia, one of the bacteria associated with severe periodontal disease plays a role in virulence. Here we show that this broad-specificity enzyme (but higher affinity for α2,3 over α2,6 linked sialic acids) digests complex glycans but not those containing Neu5,9Ac. Furthermore we show it to be a highly stable dimeric enzyme and present a thorough structural analysis of the native enzyme in its apo-form and in complex with a sialic acid analogue/ inhibitor (Oseltamivir). We also use non-catalytic (D237A) variant to characterise molecular interactions while in complex with the natural substrates 3- and 6-siallylactose. This dataset also reveals the NanH Carbohydrate Binding Module (CBM, CAZy CBM 93) has a novel fold made of antiparallel beta-strands. The catalytic domain structure contains novel features that include a non-prolyl cis-peptide and an uncommon arginine sidechain rotamer (R306) proximal to the active site. Via a mutagenesis programme, we identified key active site residues (D237, R212 and Y518) and probed the effects of mutation of residues in proximity to the glycosidic linkage within 2,3 and 2,6-linked substrates. These data revealed that mutagenesis of R306 and residues S235 &amp; V236 adjacent to the acid-base catalyst D237 influence the linkage specificity preference of this bacterial sialidase, opening up possibilities for enzyme engineering for glycotechology applications and providing key structural information that for in silico design of specific inhibitors of this enzyme for treatment of periodontitis.</td>

      <td>WHAT IS THIS SUMMARY ABOUT?: Invasive aspergillosis (also known as IA) is a type of fungal infection, caused by a species of fungus called Aspergillus, that can be life threatening. Isavuconazole and voriconazole belong to a group of antifungal drugs called triazoles that are recommended for treating IA. In the USA and in Europe, isavuconazole is approved for treating patients with IA. In China, isavuconazole was recently being reviewed for approval for treating patients with IA. This study looked at whether isavuconazole works in the same way in healthy Chinese people as it does in healthy Western people. It also looked to see how well isavuconazole works and how many side effects it has compared with voriconazole in Chinese patients with IA. WHAT WERE THE RESULTS?: The results of this study showed that healthy Chinese people's bodies processed isavuconazole the same way as healthy Western people's bodies. The amount of drug in people's bodies did not change how well the drug worked or how many side effects there were. Isavuconazole worked as well as and had a similar number of side effects as voriconazole in treating Chinese patients with IA. WHAT DO THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY MEAN?: These findings show that isavuconazole may be a suitable treatment for Chinese patients with IA using the same dose that is used in Western patients.</td>

The morphology, structure, and performance of Zr-UiO-66/MWCNTs/AuNPs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and electrochemical techniques. The Zr-UiO-66/MWCNTs/AuNPs nanohybrids exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of tetracycline, mainly because of the synergistic effect of the MOFs, MWCNTs, and gold nanoparticles. The electrochemical kinetics and catalytical mechanism of tetracycline were demonstrated, proving that tetracycline's electrocatalytic oxidation reaction was an absorption-controlled two-step process involving the transfer of two protons and two electrons, respectively. Furthermore, a simple and facile method was used to achieve the regeneration of the absorbed saturated electrode. A low concentration of tetracycline was detected by amperometry with the linear ranges of 5 × 10-7 to 2.25 × 10-4 mol L-1 (R2 = 0.9941), the sensitivity was 45.4 mA L mol-1, and the limit of detection was as low as 1.67 × 10-7 mol L-1 (S/N = 3). In addition, the composite electrode demonstrated high selectivity (interference deviation of ± 5%), satisfactory reproductivity (RSD of 5.31%), and long-term stability (easy regeneration) and was successfully applied in the analysis of tetracycline antibiotics in actual samples. Thus, the proposed electrode provides a promising and prospective MOFs-based sensing platform for the detection of tetracyclines in the environment.</td>

      <td>Linezolid Exposure Is Associated with Cytopenias in Patients Treated for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis</td>
      <td>Although linezolid is effective for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) tuberculosis treatment, it is associated with cytopenias after 4 weeks of administration. Data on toxicities with long-term use of linezolid and drug pharmacodynamics in MDR-TB treatment are limited, and concerns about toxicity present barriers to wider implementation. This was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of patients treated for MDR-TB in the country of Georgia from 2015 to 2017. Intensive blood sampling 4 to 6 weeks after treatment initiation with linezolid 600 mg daily was performed for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, including linezolid trough concentration (Cmin) and area under the curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24). Linezolid exposure was defined using literature-reported thresholds. Cytopenias were defined using an NIH adverse event (AE) scale. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between linezolid exposure and cytopenias. Among 76 patients receiving linezolid in their baseline treatment regimen and who had PK data available, cytopenia AEs occurred in 30 (39.5%) for an incidence rate of 46 per 100 person-years. The median duration of linezolid therapy was 526 days. No patients required dose reduction or interruption due to cytopenias. Median linezolid Cmin was 0.235 mg/L (interquartile range [IQR], 0.069 to 0.529), and median AUC0-24 was 89.6 mg·h/L (IQR, 69.2 to 116.2). Cytopenias were associated with linezolid PK parameters (Cmin &gt; 2 mg/L and AUC0-24 &gt; 160 mg·h/L). Cytopenias occurred frequently with long-term use of linezolid 600 mg/day and were associated with PK parameters but did not result in the need for treatment interruption in the management of a cohort of patients with MDR-TB.</td>

      <td>Role of Chromosome- and/or Plasmid-Located bla(NDM) on the Carbapenem Resistance and the Gene Stability in Escherichia coli</td>
      <td>The spread of New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-producing Enterobacterales represents a public health risk. The horizontal transfer of plasmids encoding the NDM gene, blaNDM, usually mediates its spread to other bacteria within the family. In contrast, Enterobacterales with a chromosome-located blaNDM is rarely reported. The phenotypic differences between chromosome- and plasmid-located carbapenemase genes are poorly understood. To determine the significance in terms of the location of drug resistance genes, we examined carbapenemase activity and stability of chromosome- and plasmid-located blaNDM. Escherichia coli M719 possessing both chromosomes- and plasmid-located blaNDM genes was used as a wild-type strain (WT) for the construction of mutants, ΔpblaNDM and ΔcblaNDM, wherein chromosome- or plasmid-located blaNDM, was knocked out, respectively. The mutant ΔpblaNDM showed lower hydrolyzing activity against imipenem and gene expression than the WT or ΔcblaNDM mutant. The MICs of both mutant strains were still above the breakpoint of imipenem and meropenem. Moreover, the chromosome-located blaNDM gene was stable for at least 30 days in the absence of antimicrobial pressure, whereas the ΔcblaNDM mutant lost blaNDM to 87% at 30 days compared to that of the initial inoculum. Organisms harboring the plasmid-located carbapenemase genes were found to provide a higher level of carbapenem resistance than those with chromosome-located genes. However, the latter organisms with chromosomal carbapenemase genes exhibited more stable carbapenem resistance than did the former ones. In summary, chromosomally located carbapenemase genes require further monitoring and more attention should be paid to them. IMPORTANCE Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) carrying blaNDM have spread worldwide since they were first reported in 2009. Many studies using whole-genome sequencing have identified the genetic structures, plasmid scaffolds of blaNDM, and mechanisms of spread via horizontal transfer. Chromosome-located blaNDM and integration mechanisms from plasmids have rarely been reported, and their significance is not fully understood. Here, we showed that the chromosome-located blaNDM was associated with lower levels of carbapenem resistance and carbapenemase activity than the plasmid-located blaNDM. However, it conferred carbapenem resistance above the breakpoints and the loss of chromosome-located blaNDM was not observed in the absence of antibiotic pressure. This study suggests that CRE strains carrying chromosome-located blaNDM may persist in clinical and environmental settings for a long period even without antibiotic pressure and need to be monitored along with plasmid-located blaNDM.</td>

      <td>Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, there has been much speculation about how COVID-19 and antimicrobial resistance may be interconnected. In this study, untreated wastewater was sampled from Hospital A designated to treat COVID-19 patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic alongside Hospital B that did not receive any COVID-19 patients. Metagenomics was used to determine the relative abundance and mobile potential of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), prior to determining the correlation of ARGs with time/incidence of COVID-19. Our findings showed that ARGs resistant to macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines were positively correlated with time in Hospital A but not in Hospital B. Likewise, minor extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases of classes B and D were positively correlated with time, suggesting the selection of rare and/or carbapenem-resistant genes in Hospital A. Non-carbapenemase blaVEB also positively correlated with both time and intI1 and was copresent with other ARGs including carbapenem-resistant genes in 6 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). This study highlighted concerns related to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) during the COVID-19 pandemic that may arise from antibiotic use and untreated hospital wastewater.</td>

      <td>Objective: To understand the risk factors and antibiotics-resistant patterns of invasive Acinetobacter baumannii infection in Children. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in 6 tertiary hospitals from January 2016 to December 2018. The basic information, clinical data and the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing were collected from the 98 pediatric inpatients with Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid and analyzed. According to the susceptibility of the infected strains to carbapenems, they were divided into carbapenem-sensitive Acinetobacter baumannii (CSAB) group and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) group. According to the possible sources of infection, they were divided into nosocomial infection group and community infection group. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test were used to analyze categorical variables and rank sum test were used to analyze continuous variables. The risk factors of invasive CRAB infection in children were analyzed by Logistic regression. Result: There were 56 males and 42 females in 98 cases. The onset age of patients was 8 (2, 24) months. There were 62 cases (63%) from rural area. A total of 87 cases (89%) were confirmed with bloodstream infection, and 12 cases (12%) confirmed with meningitis (1 case was accompanied with bloodstream infection). In these patients, 66 cases (67%) received invasive medical procedures or surgery, 54 cases (55%) received carbapenems-containing therapy. Twenty-four cases were infected with CRAB, and 74 cases with CSAB. The onset age of cases in CRAB group was lower than that in CSAB group (4 (1, 9) vs. 10 (4, 24) months, Z=-2.16, P=0.031). The proportions of hospitalization in intensive care unit, carbapenem antibiotics using, pneumonia and adverse prognosis in CRAB group were higher than those in CSAB group (6 cases (25%) vs. 4 cases (5%), 18 cases (75%) vs. 36 cases (49%), 17 cases (71%) vs. 17 cases (23%), 6 cases (25%) vs. 4 cases (5%), χ2=5.61, 5.09, 18.32, 5.61, all P&lt;0.05). Seventy-seven cases were nosocomial infection and 21 cases were hospital-acquired infection. The proportion of children hospitalized in high-risk wards for nosocomial infections, length of hospitalization, number of antimicrobial therapy received and duration of antimicrobial therapy were higher in the hospital associated infection group than those in the community acquired infection group (all P&lt;0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that children from rural area (OR=8.42, 95%CI 1.45-48.88), prior mechanical ventilation (OR=12.62, 95%CI 1.31-121.76), and prior antibiotic therapy (OR=4.90, 95%CI 1.35-17.72) were independent risk factors for CRAB infection. The resistance percentage of CSAB isolates to many classes of antibiotics was &lt;6% except to gentamicin, which was as high as 20% (13/65). All CRAB isolates of resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam (20/20), cefepime (23/23), piperacillin (17/17), meropenem (23/23) and imipenem (24/24) were 100%. The resistance percentage to other antibiotics were up to 42%-96%. Conclusions: Most of invasive Acinetobacter baumannii infection in children in China are hospital-acquired. The outcome of invasive CRAB infection was poorer than that of CSAB infection. The drug resistance rate of CRAB strains isolated is high. Living in rural area, prior invasive mechanical ventilation and prior antibiotic therapy were independent risk factors for invasive CRAB infection.

      <td>BACKGROUND: Periodic administration of anthelmintic drugs is a cost-effective intervention for morbidity control of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections. However, with programs expanding, drug pressure potentially selecting for drug-resistant parasites increases. While monitoring anthelmintic drug efficacy is crucial to inform country control program strategies, different factors must be taken into consideration that influence drug efficacy and make it difficult to standardize treatment outcome measures. We aimed to identify suitable approaches to assess and compare the efficacy of different anthelmintic treatments. METHODOLOGY: We built an individual participant-level database from 11 randomized controlled trials and two observational studies in which subjects received single-agent or combination therapy, or placebo. Eggs per gram of stool were calculated from egg counts at baseline and post-treatment. Egg reduction rates (ERR; based on mean group egg counts) and individual-patient ERR (iERR) were utilized to express drug efficacy and analyzed after log-transformation with a linear mixed effect model. The analyses were separated by follow-up duration (14-21 and 22-45 days) after drug administration. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The 13 studies enrolled 5,759 STH stool-positive individuals; 5,688 received active medication or placebo contributing a total of 11,103 STH infections (65% had two or three concurrent infections), of whom 3,904 (8,503 infections) and 1,784 (2,550 infections) had efficacy assessed at 14-21 days and 22-45 days post-treatment, respectively. Neither the number of helminth co-infections nor duration of follow-up affected ERR for any helminth species. The number of participants treated with single-dose albendazole was 689 (18%), with single-dose mebendazole 658 (17%), and with albendazole-based co-administrations 775 (23%). The overall mean ERR assessed by day 14-21 for albendazole and mebendazole was 94.5% and 87.4%, respectively on Ascaris lumbricoides, 86.8% and 40.8% on hookworm, and 44.9% and 23.8% on Trichuris trichiura. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended criteria for efficacy were met in 50%, 62%, and 33% studies of albendazole for A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, and hookworm, respectively and 25% of mebendazole studies. iERR analyses showed similar results, with cure achieved in 92% of A. lumbricoides-infected subjects treated with albendazole and 93% with mebendazole; corresponding figures for hookworm were 70% and 17%, and for T. trichiura 22% and 20%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Combining the traditional efficacy assessment using group averages with individual responses provides a more complete picture of how anthelmintic treatments perform. Most treatments analyzed fail to meet the WHO minimal criteria for efficacy based on group means. Drug combinations (i.e., albendazole-ivermectin and albendazole-oxantel pamoate) are promising treatments for STH infections.</td>

Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 (influent only), two over-the-counter medicines (acetaminophen and naproxen), five antibiotics (ampicillin, doxycycline, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim), two therapeutic agents (remdesivir and dexamethasone), and hydroxychloroquine. While there were no correlations between pharmaceutical and virus concentration, remdesivir detection occurred when the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients increased and dexamethasone detection co-occurred with the presence of COVID-19 patients on ventilators. Additionally, Penn State decision-making regarding instruction modes explained the temporal variation of influent pharmaceutical concentrations, with detection occurring primarily when students were on campus. Risk quotients calculated for pharmaceuticals with known EC50 or LC50 values for fish, daphnia, and algae were generally low in the effluent; however, some acute risks from sulfamethoxazole and dexamethasone were high when students returned to campus. Remdesivir and dexamethasone persisted through the wastewater treatment plants, thereby introducing novel pharmaceuticals directly to soils and surface water. These results highlight connections between human health and water quality during and further demonstrate broad utility of wastewater surveillance. This article is protected by copyright.

      <td>Evaluation of anti-parasitic activities of new quinolones containing nitrofuran moiety against Toxoplasma gondii</td>
      <td>Toxoplasmosis is a disease with a worldwide prevalence that is caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are two pharmacological agents commonly used to treat of this infection. However, they are accompanied by some side effects. Therefore, the identifying of new drugs with low toxocytosis seems to be a matter of vital importance. Quinolones are DNA replication inhibitors, exerting inhibitory effects against many pathogens, including bacteria, mycoplasma, and protozoa. Given the importance of quinolones and their efficacy, the present in vitro study was conducted to investigate the antiparasitic activities of new quinolones (NFQ-2, NFQ-5, and NFQ-6) containing nitrofuran moiety against T. gondii. To this end, Vero cells were incubated with various concentrations of new quinolones and pyrimethamine (positive control) to determine their viability. Subsequently, they were infected with T. gondii (RH strain) and then subjected to drug treatment. The obtained IC50 values were 3.60, 4.84, 5.59, 3.44 and 2.75 μg/mL for NFQ-2, NFQ-5, NFQ-6, ciprofloxacin and pyrimethamine, respectively. The CC50 values for the NFQ-2, NFQ-5, and NFQ-6 were 25.20, 29.89, and 28.43 μg/mL, indicating the selectivity indexes more than 5 for these compounds. The anti-Toxoplasma efficiency was determined by evaluating infection index, number and size of plaques, and T. gondii intracellular proliferation. As the results indicated, the administration of new quinolone derivatives resulted in the reduction of intracellular proliferation, infection index, and the number and size of plaques in comparison to uninfected treated cells (P &lt; 0.05). The results were indicative of a considerable synergetic effect when each of the derivatives was used in combination with pyrimethamine, compared to when used alone. Based on our results, the nitrofuran-derived quinolones can be considered as new leads for the design of new anti-Toxoplasma agents.</td>

      <td>Clinical Features, Antimicrobial Resistance, and Serogroups of Nontyphoidal Salmonella Isolated From Infants Less Than 3 Months Old in the Recent Decade</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Antibiotic treatment is indicated for infants with nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) enterocolitis. However, whether antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a problem among young infants is unknown. This study investigated the characteristics of NTS infections in young infants. METHODS: Infants less than 3 months old with NTS infections were enrolled and grouped into 2 cohorts (diagnosed 2010-2015 or 2016-2021). Salmonella isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid was defined as invasive NTS (iNTS). The clinical features, AMR and serogroups were compared between cohorts. RESULTS: In total, 102 young infants had NTS infections, 6.9% of which were iNTS. Infants with iNTS infections were younger, hospitalized longer, and received longer antibiotic courses. More than half of cases of iNTS were resistant to ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone and greater than or equal to 3 antibiotics. iNTS was mainly observed in Salmonella groups C2 and E. Over the past decade, group B (44%), group E (26%) and group C2 (16%) have been the most common serogroups. NTS significantly increased AMR to ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and greater than or equal to 3 antibiotics. Both multidrug resistance and extensive drug resistance in NTS also significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: The serogroups varied with time, and the main causes of iNTS, groups C2 and E, increased over the past decade. The prevalence of AMR also increased, especially for iNTS. Given the low iNTS rate and high AMR, routine antibiotic use among infants with NTS infections between 1 and 3 months old should be reconsidered. Further large-scale research is required to formulate therapeutic strategies.</td>

      <td>It is assumed that in candidates for TNF-alpha inhibitor (TNFi) treatment, tuberculin skin test (TST) may be unreliable, since BCG vaccination causes false positive and drugs cause false negative results, favoring the use of Quantiferon or T-spot assays. However, these tests may not be readily available in all parts of the world. We aimed to determine the reliability of TST with respect to BCG vaccination and drugs in candidates for TNFi treatment, and how isoniazid is tolerated, assuming that the use of TST would result in increased isoniazid use. We included 1031 adult patients who were prescribed a TNFi for the first time. We analysed the association of BCG and drugs with TST and Quantiferon results, the determinants of a positive TST, and evaluated the tolerability of isoniazid. BCG vaccination and male sex were associated with positive TST (OR 3.56, 95% CI 1.98–6.41 and OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.75–3.68, respectively), while prednisolone and azathioprine were associated with negative TST (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43–0.91 and OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11–0.76). Isoniazid was prescribed to 684 (66.3%) patients and had to be discontinued in 12.2% of these before 9 months, most commonly due to hepatotoxicity (44%). One patient developed tuberculosis despite isoniazid use. BCG vaccination may be associated with false positive TST, despite a long time since vaccination in candidates for TNFi treatment. Prednisolone and azathioprine use were associated with negative TST. Despite the high frequency of isoniazid use associated with using TST instead of QTF, isoniazid was generally well tolerated.</td>

Bronchiectasis, another risk of severe pneumonia, has not been well elucidated in RA. We investigated the types of respiratory diseases in RA and correlated them to severe pneumonia during the course of treatment using biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), with special attention to bronchiectasis and ILD. RA patients were examined by computed tomography before starting bDMARDs and divided into three groups: normal, bronchiectasis and ILD. The log-rank test and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test were employed for the statistical analysis. Among 424 patients, 350 were categorized as normal, 32 as having bronchiectasis, and 42 as having ILD. Two in the normal group, three in the bronchiectasis group and four in the ILD group developed severe pneumonia. The log-rank test showed a significant difference among the three groups (p &lt; 0.0001). The pneumonia-free rates in the bronchiectasis and ILD groups were significantly lower than the normal group, respectively, with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (p &lt; 0.0001). This study suggests that the bronchiectasis that occurs in RA carries a risk of severe pneumonia during treatment with bDMARDs that is comparable to ILD.</td>

Pulmonary manifestations with recurrent pneumonia and bronchiectasis have rarely been described as the predominant presentation of juvenile lupus and may suggest an alternate differential like primary immunodeficiency, especially in early childhood. We describe a case of 10-year girl who presented with a history of recurrent pneumonia, arthritis, alopecia, and poor weight gain for the past 2 years. On examination, she had respiratory distress, bilateral diffuse crackles and arthritis of the small joints of hands. Lab investigations showed pancytopenia, low complement levels and high titers of ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies. The patient was diagnosed with juvenile lupus. Imaging studies revealed evidence of multiple lobar collapse and consolidation with bronchiectasis. She was started on steroids, HCQ and supportive measures for bronchiectasis. The child reported relief in initial symptoms of lupus on follow-up but developed recurrent thrombocytopenia requiring IVIG and escalating the doses of oral steroids. The young age and atypical presentation prompted a screening for monogenic lupus, and clinical exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous missense variation in exon 20 of the C4Agene with clinically reduced C4 levels, consistent with the diagnosis of C4A deficiency.</td>

      <td>A review of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors from plants as potential candidates for the treatment of type-2 diabetes</td>
      <td>Diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial global health disorder that is rising at an alarming rate. Cardiovascular diseases, kidney damage and neuropathy are the main cause of high mortality rates among individuals with diabetes. One effective therapeutic approach for controlling hyperglycemia associated with type-2 diabetes is to target alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, enzymes that catalyzes starch hydrolysis in the intestine. At present, approved inhibitors for these enzymes are restricted to acarbose, miglitol and voglibose. Although these inhibitors retard glucose absorption, undesirable gastrointestinal side effects impede their application. Therefore, research efforts continue to seek novel inhibitors with improved efficacy and minimal side effects. Natural products of plant origin have been a valuable source of therapeutic agents with lesser toxicity and side effects. The anti-diabetic potential through alpha-glucosidase inhibition of plant-derived molecules are summarized in this review. Eight molecules (Taxumariene F, Akebonoic acid, Morusin, Rhaponticin, Procyanidin A2, Alaternin, Mulberrofuran K and Psoralidin) were selected as promising drug candidates and their pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity were discussed where available.</td>

      <td>Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare skin condition which is difficult to diagnose as it often presents similarly to common complications such as wound infection, tissue ischemia and necrotizing fasciitis. We present a patient who underwent immediate DIEP free flap breast reconstruction and developed post-surgical pyoderma gangrenosum (PSPG), initially with non-characteristic signs and symptoms. Our patient first developed severe headache, fever and erythema surrounding her wound. The classical signs of painful ulcers with undermined bluish borders and surrounding violaceous rash were not seen for nearly 4 weeks. This, in combination with positive wound culture, made for a challenging diagnosis in an elective breast reconstruction patient. Diagnosis of PSPG relies on clinical signs first and is supported by wound swab culture and sensitivity and tissue biopsy for histopathology. The treatment of choice for PSPG is high-dose systemic steroids followed by an oral prednisolone taper over a period of 4–6 weeks. Early diagnosis of PSPG can optimize outcomes and reduce morbidity. We should consider PSPG as a differential diagnosis when post-operative wound infection is suspected, particularly if a non-classical pattern is seen. We could also consider discussion of PSPG as a rare, yet serious complication during the consent process. Level of evidence: Level V, diagnostic study.</td>

      <td>Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a severe chronic disease with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. SSc displays disturbed lymphocyte homeostasis. Immunosuppressive medications targeting T or B cells can improve disease manifestations. SSc clinical manifestations and immunosuppressive medication in itself can cause changes in lymphocyte subsets. The aim of this study was to investigate peripheral lymphocyte homeostasis in SSc with regards to the immunosuppression and to major organ involvement. 44 SSc patients and 19 healthy donors (HD) were included. Immunophenotyping of peripheral whole blood by fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed. Cytokine secretions of stimulated B cell cultures were measured. SSc patients without immunosuppression compared to HD displayed lower γδ T cells, lower T helper cells (CD3(+)/CD4(+)), lower transitional B cells (CD19(+)/CD38(++)/CD10(+)/IgD(+)), lower pre-switched memory B cells (CD19(+)/CD27(+)/IgD(+)), and lower post-switched memory B cells (CD19(+)/CD27(+)/IgD(−)). There was no difference in the cytokine production of whole B cell cultures between SSc and HD. Within the SSc cohort, mycophenolate intake was associated with lower T helper cells and lower NK cells (CD56(+)/CD3(−)). The described differences in peripheral lymphocyte subsets between SSc and HD generate further insight in SSc pathogenesis. Lymphocyte changes under effective immunosuppression indicate how lymphocyte homeostasis in SSc might be restored.</td>

Methods: The ART-naïve HIV-infected adults were randomly assigned to start ART immediately or defer ART until the WHO criteria were met. Participants who completed the trial follow-up were invited to participate in a post-trial phase (PTP). The PTP end-point was all-cause death. We used multivariable Cox proportional models to analyse the association between baseline sVCAM-1 and all-cause death, adjusting for ART strategy, sex, CD4 count, plasma HIV-1 RNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cell HIV-1 DNA levels. Results: In all, 954 adults (77% women, median CD4 count of 387 cells/μL) were randomly assigned to start ART immediately (n = 477) or to defer initiation of ART (n = 477). They were followed for a median of 5.8 years [interquartile range (IQR): 5.2–6.3]. In multivariable analysis, the risk of death was significantly associated with baseline sVCAM-1 [≥1458 vs. &lt; 1458 ng/mL; adjusted hazard ratio = 2.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.60–5.11]. The 6-year probability of death rates were 14.4% (95%CI: 9.1–22.6) and 9.4% (5.4–16.1) in patients with baseline sVCAM-1 ≥ 1458 ng/mL randomized to deferred and immediate ART, respectively, and 3.8% (2.2–6.5) and 3.5% (1.9–6.3) in patients with baseline sVCAM-1 &lt; 1458 ng/mL randomized to deferred and immediate ART. The median difference between pre-ART and 12-month sVCAM-1 levels in patients randomized to immediate ART was −252 (IQR: −587 to −61). Conclusions: Pre-ART sVCAM-1 levels were significantly associated with mortality, independently of whether ART was started immediately or deferred, but they significantly decreased after 12 months of ART.</td>

      <td>Severe SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by lymphopenia, but the mechanisms involved are still elusive. Based on our knowledge of HIV pathophysiology, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated lymphopenia could also be related to T cell apoptosis. By comparing intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU COVID-19 patients with age-matched healthy donors, we found a strong positive correlation between plasma levels of soluble FasL (sFasL) and T cell surface expression of Fas/CD95 with the propensity of T cells to die and CD4 T cell counts. Plasma levels of sFasL and T cell death are correlated with CXCL10 which is part of the signature of 4 biomarkers of disease severity (ROC, 0.98). We also found that members of the Bcl-2 family had modulated in the T cells of COVID-19 patients. More importantly, we demonstrated that the pan-caspase inhibitor, Q-VD, prevents T cell death by apoptosis and enhances Th1 transcripts. Altogether, our results are compatible with a model in which T-cell apoptosis accounts for T lymphopenia in individuals with severe COVID-19. Therefore, a strategy aimed at blocking caspase activation could be beneficial for preventing immunodeficiency in COVID-19 patients.</td>

Approach and Results: We used HCV-TARGET registry data to identify HCV-infected adults receiving all-oral DAA treatment and having virologic outcome. Potential pretreatment predictors (n = 179) included sociodemographic, clinical characteristics, and virologic data. We applied multivariable logistic regression as well as elastic net, random forest, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and feedforward neural network machine learning algorithms to predict DAA treatment failure. Training (n = 4894) and validation (n = 1631) patient samples had similar sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (mean age, 57 years; 60% male; 66% White; 36% with cirrhosis). Of 6525 HCV-infected adults, 95.3% achieved sustained virologic response, whereas 4.7% experienced DAA treatment failure. In the validation sample, machine learning approaches performed similarly in predicting DAA treatment failure (C statistic [95% CI]: GBM, 0.69 [0.64–0.74]; random forest, 0.68 [0.63–0.73]; feedforward neural network, 0.66 [0.60–0.71]; elastic net, 0.64 [0.59–0.70]), and all four outperformed multivariable logistic regression (0.51 [0.46–0.57]). Using the Youden index to identify the balanced risk score threshold, GBM had 66.2% sensitivity and 65.1% specificity, and 12 individuals were needed to evaluate to identify 1 DAA treatment failure. Over 55% of patients with treatment failure were classified by the GBM in the top three risk decile subgroups (positive predictive value: 6%–14%). The top 10 GBM-identified predictors included albumin, liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase), total bilirubin levels, sex, HCV viral loads, sodium level, HCC, platelet levels, and tobacco use.

We present the case of a 72-year-old man with PJI 6 months after total knee arthroplasty. Two-stage revision surgery was followed by culture-directed antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin and rifampicin) against Staphylococcus aureus isolated from the periprosthetic tissue.

The patient was normotensive without a maculopapular rash, urticaria or clotting abnormalities. A drug fever was suspected, and rifampicin was discontinued. A re-challenge test was performed, and the fever recurred. Antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin was continued and, after 12 months of follow-up, the patient was doing well. Clinicians should be aware that fever could be a clinical presentation of drug fever. If it occurs during an infection, drug fever could necessitate additional diagnostic procedures for further evaluation, inadequate antibiotic therapy and prolonged hospitalisation.</td>

      <td>Background: Anastomotic leakage remains one of the most threatening complications in colorectal surgery. Intraoperative testing of anastomosis may reduce the postoperative anastomotic leakage rates. This study aimed to investigate a novel comprehensive intraoperative colorectal anastomosis testing technique to detect the failure of the anastomosis construction and to reduce the risk of postoperative leak. Methods: This multi-centre prospective cohort pilot study included 60 patients who underwent colorectal resection with an anastomosis at or below 15 cm from the anal verge. Comprehensive trimodal testing consisted of indocyanine green fluorescence angiography, tension testing, air-leak, and methylene blue leak tests to evaluate the perfusion, tension, and mechanical integrity of the anastomosis. Results: Ten (16.7%) patients developed an anastomotic leakage. Trimodal test was positive in 16 (26.6%) patients and the operative plan was changed for all of them. Diverting ileostomy was performed in 14 (87.5%) patients. However, two (12.5%) patients still developed clinically significant anastomotic leakage (Grade B). Forty-four (73.4%) patients had a negative trimodal test, preventive ileostomy was performed in 19 (43.2%), and five (11.4%) patients had clinically significant anastomotic leakage (Grade B and C). Conclusion: Trimodal testing identifies anastomoses with initial technical failure where reinforcement of anastomosis or diversion can lead to an acceptable rate of anastomotic leakage. Identification of well-performed anastomosis could allow a reduction of ileostomy rate by two-fold. However, anastomotic leakage rate remains high in technically well-performed anastomoses.</td>

Results: Fibrotic material, consisting of collagen fibrils, microfibrils, pseudoexfoliation fibrils produced by activated fibroblasts, was detected in the stent lumen of 4/5 pseudoexfoliation glaucoma patients and also in posttraumatic open-angle glaucoma. Fibrotic material was also present on the outer surface and within fenestrations of the majority of stents. Complete absence of fibrotic reaction was noticed in 3 of 9 microstents. Conclusion: Although MIGS is known to be less invasive than conventional surgery, implants placed in the suprachoroidal space may be adversely affected by a fibrotic tissue reaction resulting in implant failure. Understanding mechanisms and risk factors leading to fibrotic scarring following antiglaucomatous surgery may help to develop novel strategies that improve surgical outcome.</td>

      <td>Aspirin use and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis B with or without cirrhosis</td>
      <td>Background and Aims: Studies on differential effect of aspirin therapy on HCC risk across the spectrum of liver diseases are lacking. We investigated the association between aspirin use and risks of HCC, liver-associated death, and major bleeding in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with or without cirrhosis. Approach and Results: We identified 329,635 eligible adults with CHB from 2007 through 2017, using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, including patients who received aspirin for ≥90 consecutive days (n = 20,200) and patients who never received antiplatelet therapy (n = 309,435). Risks of HCC, liver-associated mortality, and major bleeding were estimated in a propensity-score–matched cohort (19,003 pairs), accounting for competing risks. With a median follow-up of 6.7 years, 10-year cumulative incidence of HCC was 9.5% in the aspirin-treated group and 11.3% in the untreated group (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [aSHR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78–0.92). However, among patients with cirrhosis (2479 pairs), an association of aspirin use with HCC risk was not evident (aSHR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.85–1.18). Cirrhosis status had a significant effect on the association between aspirin use and HCC risk (p(interaction), n = 0.04). Aspirin use was also associated with lower liver-associated mortality (aSHR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71–0.90). Moreover, aspirin use was not associated with major bleeding risk (aSHR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.99–1.21). Conclusions: Aspirin use was associated with reduced risks of HCC and liver-associated mortality in adults with CHB. Cirrhosis status had a substantial effect on the association between aspirin use and HCC risk.</td>

      <td>Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NR) use has not yet been described in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) with mild COVID-19. The objective was to evaluate outcomes among SOTR and describe the drug–drug interaction of NR. This is an IRB-approved, retrospective study of all adult SOTR on a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor who were prescribed NR between December 28, 2021 and January 6, 2022. A total of 25 adult SOTR were included (n = 21 tacrolimus, n = 4 cyclosporine, n = 3 everolimus, n = 1 sirolimus). All patients were instructed to follow the following standardized protocol during treatment with 5 days of NR: hold tacrolimus or mTOR inhibitor or reduce cyclosporine dose to 20% of baseline daily dose. Four patients (16%) were hospitalized by day 30; one for infectious diarrhea and three for symptoms related to COVID-19. No patients died within 30 days of receipt of NR. Median tacrolimus level pre- and post-NR were 7.4 ng/ml (IQR, 6.6–8.6) and 5.2 (IQR, 3.6–8.7), respectively. Four patients experienced a supratherapeutic tacrolimus concentration after restarting tacrolimus post-NR. Our results show the clinically significant interaction between NR and immunosuppressive agents can be reasonably managed with a standardized dosing protocol. Prescribers should carefully re-introduce CNI after the NR course is complete.</td>

      <td>Dolichoectasia: a brain arterial disease with an elusive treatment</td>
      <td>Introduction: Dolichoectasia is a form of brain large artery disease associated with a high risk of mortality and morbidity. Progressive enlargement of arterial size is a predictor of mortality, but there are no specific treatments for arresting or slowing down dilatation. Additionally, dilated brain arteries can cause flow stagnation, which can trigger thrombosis and cause stroke. Pathology and genetic studies indicate a possible role for increased matrix metalloproteinase activation in arterial dilatation and thus in the pathophysiology of dolichoectasia. Therefore, therapeutic interventions aimed at slowing down arterial dilatation and preventing thrombosis could hypothetically play a role in treating patients with dolichoectasia. Methods: We present four patients with dolichoectasia that exemplify therapeutic challenges worth discussing in the context of the current literature. Two patients were treated off-label with doxycycline (based on its antiMMP properties) and with apixaban, one patient was put on warfarin and later switched to aspirin, and the fourth patient underwent endovascular treatment. Results: We report four cases, all men 50 years or older. Of the two patients treated with doxycycline, we noted a slowdown of the basilar artery (BA) growth, but the BA continued to grow in the other patient. Of the two patients who received apixaban, none had a subsequent stroke in 5 and 4 years of follow-up, respectively. One patient was admitted with a fatal BA thrombosis and rupture, and pathological examination of the brain arteries demonstrated advanced arterial wall degeneration but no atherosclerosis. Discussion: These cases exemplify the challenges of treating people with dolichoectasia and highlight the need for better evidence regarding the best possible treatment for this population.</td>

      <td>Protracted course progressive supranuclear palsy</td>
      <td>Background and purpose: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) encompasses a broader range of disease courses than previously appreciated. The most frequent clinical presentations of PSP are Richardson syndrome (RS) and PSP with a predominant Parkinsonism phenotype (PSP-P). Time to reach gait dependence and cognitive impairment have been proposed as prognostic disease milestones. Genetic polymorphisms in TRIM11 and SLC2A13 genes have been associated with longer disease duration (DD). Methods: Methods used include retrospective chart review, genetic single nucleotide polymorphism analyses (in three cases), and neuropathology. Results: We identified four cases with long (&gt;10–15 years) or very long (&gt;15 years) DD. Stage 1 PSP tau pathology was present in two cases (one PSP-P and one undifferentiated phenotype), whereas pallidonigroluysian atrophy (PSP-RS) and Stage 4/6 (PSP-P) PSP pathology were found in the other two cases. Three cases were homozygous for the rs564309-C allele of the TRIM11 gene and the H1 MAPT haplotype. Two were heterozygous for rs2242367 (G/A) in SLC2A13, whereas the third was homozygous for the G-allele. Conclusions: We propose a protracted course subtype of PSP (PC-PSP) based on clinical or neuropathological criteria in two cases with anatomically restricted PSP pathology, and very long DD and slower clinical progression in the other two cases. The presence of the rs564309-C allele may influence the protracted disease course. Crystallizing the concept of PC-PSP is important to further understand the pathobiology of tauopathies in line with current hypotheses of protein misfolding, seeding activity, and propagation.</td>

      <td>Background: As evidence continues to accumulate regarding the multi-organ dysfunction associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD), it is still unclear as to whether PD increases the risk of hematological pathology. In this study, the authors investigate the association between PD and hematological pathology risk factors. Methods: This retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using 8 years of the National Readmission Database. All individuals diagnosed with PD were queried at the time of primary admission. Readmissions, complications, and risk factors were analyzed at 30-, 90-, 180-, and 300-day intervals. Statistical analysis included multivariate Gaussian-fitted modeling using age, sex, comorbidities, and discharge weights as covariates. Coefficients of model variables were exponentiated and interpreted as odds ratios. Results: The database query yielded 1,765,800 PD patients (mean age: 76.3 ± 10.4; 44.1% female). Rates of percutaneous blood transfusion in readmitted patients at 30, 90, 180, and 300 days were found to be 8.7%, 8.6%, 8.3%, and 8.3% respectively. Those with anti-parkinsonism medication side effects at the primary admission had increased rates of gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage (OR: 1.02; 95%CI: 1.01–1.03, p &lt; 0.0001) and blood transfusion (OR: 1.06; 95%CI: 1.05–1.08, p &lt; 0.0001) at all timepoints after readmission. PD patients who experienced GI hemorrhage of any etiology, including as a side effect of anti-parkinsonism medication, were found to have significantly higher rates of blood transfusion at all timepoints (OR: 1.14; 95%CI: 1.13–1.16, p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: Blood transfusions were found to be significantly associated with anti-parkinsonism drug side effects and GI hemorrhage of any etiology.</td>

      <td>With moderate level of evidence, 76% of delegates (super majority/strong consensus) of the most recent (2018) International Consensus Meeting on orthopedic infections agreed that extended oral antibiotics directed toward initial organisms after reimplantation for 3 months probably reduce the risk of failure due to periprosthetic joint infection. Nevertheless, the use of oral antibiotics becomes increasingly problematic with extended or long-term utilization. The development of antibiotic resistance and side effects are of particular concern, the most common being Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea. Antibiotic stewardship is important when preventing and treating periprosthetic joint infection to hopefully prevent increase of bacterial antibiotic resistance. Two recent studies showed a significant difference in the incidence of surgical site infections after arthroplasty procedures in high-risk patients during short- and long-term follow-up without significant increase of adverse effects. However, another study showed no significant benefit of this practice. This summary discussed the details of those studies suggesting that the use of extended oral antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk primary and revision hip and knee arthroplasty may reduce infection rates; nonetheless, additional higher level of evidence (level 1) is still needed to validate this practice as its potential adverse effects are not clear.</td>

The demographic and disease-related characteristics were recorded and inflammatory markers in sera were measured. RA patients were guided to fill out PHQ-9 scale by themselves, the psychological state was evaluated by psychiatry experts and graded according to the HAMD-17 scale. The consistency of the two scales in judging depression was evaluated. RA with depression group had HAMD-17 scores greater than 7. The levels of CRP, ESR, fibrinogen, SAA, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-10 were measured and compared. Logistic regression analysis was performed to find the risk factors of RA with different depression levels. One hundred-five (48.84%) RA patients had HAMD-17 scores greater than 7. High consistency was found between HAMD-17 and PHQ-9 in predicting depression. RA patients with depression were more likely to have tender joints, lower income, no employment, higher disease activity, joint deformities and glucocorticoid treatment. The depressed RA patients had higher serum levels of IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen, and SAA. IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen, and SAA were positive correlated with depression in RA patients. PHQ-9 can replace HAMD-17 in clinical application to judge depression.</td>

Aims: to evaluate the impact of HBsAg kinetics before treatment interruption on post-treatment response. Methods: Longitudinal, ambispective study in non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis B HBeAg-negative patients, analysing on-treatment and post-treatment HBsAg kinetics. On-treatment HBsAg kinetics diagnostic accuracy (AUROC) to identify HBsAg loss was evaluated. Results: 52 HBeAg-negative patients stopped treatment after 8.2 years, and 6 (11.5%) achieved HBsAg loss one year after withdrawal. Multivariate analysis showed that on-treatment HBsAg kinetics was related to HBsAg loss (OR=0.10; 95%CI=0.016–0.632; p = 0.014) with a high diagnostic accuracy (AUROC=0.935). A significant HBsAg decline ≥1 log10 IU/mL showed a positive and negative predictive value of 50% and of 97.6%, respectively. After treatment interruption, HBsAg decline speed (log10 IU/mL/year) accelerated in patients treated &gt;6 years (from -0.06 to -0.20, p&lt;0.05) and remained stable in treated &lt;6 years (from -0.12 to -0.12 p=ns). Conclusions: On-treatment HBsAg kinetics can predict post-treatment HBsAg loss rate. Half of patients with a significant HBsAg decline can eliminate HBsAg the first year after withdrawal. Post-treatment HBsAg decline is faster not only in patients who lost the HBsAg but also in those who remain HBsAg-positive.</td>

The present study was undertaken to investigate factors associated with first dispensing of HCQ/CQ. Methods: Using Medicaid insurance claims from 2000 to 2010, we identified individuals ages 18–65 years with incident SLE (≥3 SLE International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes separated by ≥30 days without prior SLE codes or HCQ/CQ use for 24 months). The primary outcome was first dispensing of HCQ/CQ within 24 months of the first SLE code. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to examine the association between sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, health care utilization, and medication use and HCQ/CQ dispensing within 24 months of diagnosis. Results: We identified 9,560 Medicaid beneficiaries with incident SLE; 41% received HCQ (n = 3,949) or CQ (n = 14) within 24 months of diagnosis. Younger patients were more likely to receive HCQ/CQ. Black, Asian, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native individuals were more likely to receive HCQ/CQ than White individuals. Alcohol and nicotine use, chronic pain, diabetes mellitus, and end-stage renal disease were associated with lower dispensing. Appointments and preventive care services were associated with higher rates, and more hospitalizations with lower rates. Conclusion: Only 41% of Medicaid beneficiaries with SLE received HCQ/CQ within 24 months of diagnosis. Greater outpatient and preventive care increased receipt. All non-White race/ethnicities had higher rates of first dispensing. Time to initial HCQ/CQ dispensing may not explain racial/ethnic disparities in adverse outcomes, highlighting the need to consider other care quality-related issues and medication adherence challenges.</td>

      <td>Background: Although studies have demonstrated reductions in recurrent periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) with the administration of prolonged oral antibiotics at second-stage reimplantation, the potential for increasing bacterial resistance has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine if oral antibiotics at second-stage reimplantation increased the rate of antibiotic resistance in subsequent infections. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent 2-stage exchange for chronic PJI from 2014 to 2019. We compared those who had received prolonged oral antibiotics at the time of stage 2 reimplantation with those who did not. The primary outcome was the presence of resistant organisms in any subsequent infection. The secondary outcome was the overall rate of recurrent PJI in the 2 groups. Multivariable analyses controlling for demographics and comorbid conditions were used. Results: Of the 211 patients who underwent 2-stage exchange for PJI, 158 patients received prolonged oral antibiotics. The mean follow-up was 2.2 years. Recurrent PJI was diagnosed in 24 of 158 (15%) patients who received oral antibiotics compared with 11 of 53 (21%) patients who did not receive antibiotics (P =.35). PJI with resistant organisms was identified in 16 of 24 (67%) patients who received antibiotics compared with 0 of 11 (0%) patients who did not receive antibiotics (P =.0001). Conclusions: Prolonged oral antibiotics following 2-stage exchange increase drug resistance to that antibiotic in subsequent PJI. We recommend further research in the area to refine antimicrobial protocols as we consider the risks and benefits of prolonged antibiotic treatment.</td>

      <td>Acute Pericarditis: Update</td>
      <td>Purpose of Review: Since 2015, when ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases were published, ongoing research has enhanced the current state of knowledge on acute pericarditis. This review is an update on the latest developments in this field. Recent Findings: In recurrent acute pericarditis, autoinflammation has been included among causative mechanisms restricting the vague diagnoses of “idiopathic” pericarditis. Cardiac magnetic resonance that detects ongoing pericardial inflammation may guide treatment in difficult-to-treat patients. Development of risk scores may assist identification of patients at high risk for complicated pericarditis, who should be closely monitored and aggressively treated. Treatment with IL-1 inhibitors has been proven efficacious in recurrent forms with a good safety profile. Finally, acute pericarditis has recently attracted great interest as it has been reported among side effects post COVID-19 vaccination and may also complicate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Summary: Recent advancements in acute pericarditis have contributed to a better understanding of the disease allowing a tailored to the individual patient approach. However, there are still unsolved questions that require further research.</td>

      <td>The acute effects of azithromycin use on cardiovascular mortality as compared with amoxicillin–clavulanate in US Veterans</td>
      <td>Purpose: Azithromycin is a common first-line antibiotic for respiratory infection; however, there is conflicting evidence regarding risk of cardiovascular death. We assessed cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality associated with azithromycin versus amoxicillin–clavulanate among US Veterans treated for nonear–nose–throat respiratory infection (“respiratory”) or ear–nose–throat infection indication. Methods: Electronic health record data from the US Veterans Health Administration database were used to identify Veterans (30–74 years) with outpatient dispensings of oral azithromycin versus amoxicillin–clavulanate for respiratory or ear–nose–throat infection (January 01, 2000–December 31, 2014). Outcomes assessed were risk of cardiovascular death and noncardiovascular death within 1–5 and 6–10 days postdispensing. Inverse probability of treatment-weighted proportional hazards models and binomial regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and compute risk differences (RD) per million courses of therapy. Cardiac death (subset of cardiovascular death) was assessed in sensitivity analyses. Results: There were 629 345 azithromycin and 168 429 amoxicillin–clavulanate dispensings for respiratory indications, 143 783 azithromycin, and 203 142 amoxicillin–clavulanate dispensings for ear–nose–throat indications. For respiratory indications, azithromycin was not associated with a significantly different risk of cardiovascular death versus amoxicillin–clavulanate within 1–5 days postdispensing (HR [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.12 [0.63, 2.00]; RD [95% CI]: 11 [−43, 64] deaths/million courses of therapy). No elevated risk for azithromycin was found for ear–nose–throat indications. Pooled results for both indications via meta-analysis showed no association between antibiotics and cardiovascular mortality. There was no significant difference in risk of noncardiovascular or cardiac death between antibiotics postdispensing. Conclusion: Azithromycin was not associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular or noncardiovascular death versus amoxicillin–clavulanate among US Veterans.</td>

      <td>Association of Human Leucocyte Antigen Class II, with viral load and immune response to Epstein–Barr virus in adult and pediatric Systemic lupus erythematosus patients</td>
      <td>Objective: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease, which is known to be associated with HLA-DRB1 and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection. In the Indian subcontinent where there is high seroendemicity of EBV, we postulated that the association of this virus in adult SLE (aSLE) and pediatric SLE (pSLE) patients would be different and differentially associate with the HLA-DRB1 susceptibility and protective genes. Methods: A total of 109 aSLE, 52 pSLE, 215 adult healthy and 63 pediatric healthy controls were recruited. HLA-DRB1 genotyping by PCR-SSP, EBV load estimation by real-time PCR and antibody profiling (IgG &amp; IgM) to EBV antigens by line blot assay were performed. Results: DRB1*15 was found predominant in pSLE patients and DRB1*03 in aSLE patients. DRB1*15/X heterozygous was predominant in overall SLE patients, although disease severity, like hypocomplementemia, higher autoantibody levels and more organ involvement was observed in *15/*15 homozygous state. EBV strongly associated with pSLE patients showing higher percent of EA-D IgG (p &lt; 0.0001) and p22 IgG (p = 0.035) along with higher viral load (p = 0.001) as compared to healthy controls. In addition, the higher EBV DNA load significantly associated with anti-EA-D IgG (p = 0.013) and DRB1*15/*15 (p = 0.007) in pSLE patients as compared to aSLE patients. Conclusions: This study therefore indicates that different HLA-DRB1 allotypes confer susceptibility to SLE in children and adults and disease may be triggered by increased EBV reactivation.</td>

      <td>COVID-19 Mortality and Therapeutics in Nebraska and Southwest Iowa during Early Pandemic</td>
      <td>Abstract: BACKGROUNDDifferent pharmacotherapeutics have been introduced, and then stopped or continued, for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the risks associated with mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Data was concurrently or retrospectively captured on COVID-19 hospitalized patients from 6 regional hospitals within the health system. Demographic details, the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection, concomitant disease status, as well as the therapeutic agents used for treating SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., antimicrobials, dexamethasone, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab, and remdesivir) were recorded. Discrete and continuous variables were analyzed using SPSS (ver. 27). Logistic regression identified variables significantly correlated with mortality. RESULTS: 471 patients (admitted from 1 March 2020 through 15 July 2020) were reviewed. Mean (±SD) age and body weight (kg) were 62.5 ± 17.7 years and 86.3 ± 27.1 kg, respectively. Patients were Caucasian (50%), Hispanic (34%), African-American (10%), or Asian (5%). Females accounted for 52% of patients. Therapeutic modalities used for COVID-19 illness included remdesivir (16%), dexamethasone (35%), convalescent plasma (17.8%), and tocilizumab (5.8%). The majority of patients returned home (62%) or were transferred to a skilled nursing facility (23%). The overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2 was 14%. Logistic regression identified variables significantly correlated with mortality. Intubation, receipt of dexamethasone, African-American or Asian ethnicity, and being a patient from a nursing home were significantly associated with mortality (x(2) = 86.36 (13) p &lt; 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infected hospitalized patients had significant mortality risk if they were intubated, received dexamethasone, were of African-American or Asian ethnicity, or occupied a nursing home bed prior to hospital admission.</td>

Common manifestations are related to hypercalcemia, which is caused by primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Brown tumors are infrequent as initial presentation of PHPT associated with MEN 1. It occurs in less than 2% of MEN 1 population. Results: A 36-year-old woman started the disease 25 years ago in an insidious and progressive manner. She presented a soft tumor in the left malar region that progressively increased in volume. We treated recurrent multiple brown tumors in a patient with PHPT and pituitary adenoma. Conclusion: The follow-up was demanding and multidisciplinary. The long-term prognosis is uncertain; therefore, close monitoring of the patient should be carried out through clinical, laboratory and imaging evaluation.</td>

      <td>Background/purpose of the study: Mortality from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is high. Severe infection is the most important complication that affects the outcomes of ACLF patients. Thymosin α1 (Tα1) can improve immune imbalance and this study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Tα1 treatment for HBV-related ACLF. Methods: From 2017 to 2019, 120 patients with HBV-related ACLF were enrolled in this open-label, randomized, and controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrial ID: NCT 03082885). The control group (N = 58) was treated with standard medical therapy (SMT) only. The experimental group (N = 56) was subcutaneously injected with 1.6 mg of Tα1 once a day for the first week and then twice a week from week 2 to week 12. Results: The 90-day cumulated liver transplantation free survival rate of the Tα1 group was 75.0% (95% confidence interval 63.2–86.8%) versus 53.4% (95% confidence interval 39.7–67.1%) for the SMT group (p = 0.030). No significant difference was found in the survival using competitive risk analysis. The incidences of new infection and hepatic encephalopathy in the Tα1 group were much lower than those in the SMT group (32.1% vs 58.6%, p = 0.005; 8.9% vs 24.1%, p = 0.029, respectively). Mortality from severe infection in the SMT group was higher than in the Tα1 group (24.1% vs 8.9%, p = 0.029). Conclusion: Tα1 is safe for patients with HBV-related ACLF and significantly improves the 90-day liver transplantation-free survival rate. There may be a subgroup which may benefit from Tα1 therapy by the mechanism of preventing infection.</td>

Objective: This case series aims to present challenges in defining cutaneous manifestations of famo-tidine in the context of COVID-19. Case Presentation: We identified patients from Imam Khomeini hospital complex who were admitted to the ward due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), were taking famotidine and having cutaneous rash. Clinical data were obtained through observation and intervention. Discussion: We found 4 SARS-CoV-2 patients with cutaneous manifestations. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 57±2 years, 3 patients were men, and their COVID-19 symptoms appeared 10±3 days before admission. The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath. All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Patients received famotidine for gas-trointestinal prophylaxis, and all 4 patients developed Acral macular mountainous skin lesions in the upper and lower extremities, then we discontinued famotidine and lesions were recovered com-pletely in all patients. Conclusion: These cases prompted us to inform clinicians about cutaneous complications of famo-tidine in COVID-19 patients.</td>

      <td>Background: Perry syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant parkinsonian disorder characterized by respiratory failure. The variability in respiratory presentation in this condition is incompletely understood. Cases: We report 2 first-degree relatives with Perry syndrome attributed to the same mutation in the Dynactin 1 (DCTN1) gene. Their clinical presentations with respect to parkinsonism and respiratory failure were heterogeneous. The proband presented with acute respiratory failure requiring invasive ventilation on a background of parkinsonism and remains alive more than 3 years later with a good levodopa response. We contrast this with the published literature, in which acute respiratory presentations were associated with a poor outcome. The proband's brother presented with parkinsonism together with early falls and gait impairment and died following gradual hypoventilation despite noninvasive respiratory support. Conclusions: Perry syndrome can show intrafamily heterogeneity in both movement disorder and respiratory presentations. Acute respiratory failure is often but not always associated with a poor outcome.</td>

      <td>Role of Tocilizumab in the Treatment of COVID-19 Patients with Cytokine Storm: A Case Series</td>
      <td>The in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 could be correlated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 induced hyper-inflammation, which is attributed to an unconstrained inflammatory cytokine storm. The pro-inflammatory cytokine, specifically, interleukin-6 plays a prominent role in the cytokine storm and may result in alveolar-capillary blood-gas exchange dysfunction. Therefore, the method to block the signal transduction pathway of interleukin-6 could be a potential treatment for severe COVID-19 patients. In this case series of three patients with severe COVID-19, we focus on the rationale for utilization of tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, which could block the signal transduction pathway of interleukin-6. The observations from this study allowed us to hypothesize that the infusions of tocilizumab may not reduce the elevated level of interleukin-6, and hence may not be a significant therapeutic for reducing in-hospital mortality associated with COVID-19. Additionally, it could also be speculated that interleukin-6 may not be a potentially actionable target cytokine to treat COVID-19-associated cytokine storms.</td>

Risk factors for enteric leak were examined and outcomes of attempted graft salvage were compared to immediate pancreatectomy. Pancreas transplants performed between 1995 and 2018 were reviewed. Donor, recipient, and organ variables including demographics, donor type, ischemic time, kidney donor profile index, and pancreas donor risk index were analyzed. Among 1153 patients, 33 experienced enteric leaks (2.9%). Donors of allografts that developed leak were older (37.9y vs. 29.0y, p =.001), had higher KDPI (37% vs. 24%, p &lt;.001), higher pancreas donor risk index (1.83 vs. 1.32, p &lt;.001), and longer cold ischemic time (16.5 vs. 14.8 h, p =.03). Intra-abdominal abscess and higher blood loss decreased the chance of successful salvage. Enteric leak increased 6-month graft loss risk (HR 13.9[CI 8.5–22.9], p &lt;.001). However, 50% (n = 12) of allografts undergoing attempted salvage survived long-term. After 6 months of pancreas graft survival, salvage and non-leak groups had similar 5-year graft survival (82.5% vs. 81.5%) and mortality (90.9% vs. 93.5%). Enteric leaks remain a challenging complication. Pancreatic allograft salvage can be attempted in suitable patients and accomplished in 50% of cases without significantly increased graft failure or mortality risk.</td>

Chloroquine (CLQ) is an anti-inflammatory agent that is widely used in the treatment of inflammation-related diseases such as malaria and rheumatoid arthritis. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of CLQ in the hypoxia-induced testicular damage via assessment of hypoxic response, endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. For this purpose, 32 Wistar albino rats were divided into 4 groups as control (given 20%-21% O(2), no treatment), CLQ (given 50 mg/kg and 20%-21% O(2) for 28 days), hypoxia (HX) (given 10% O(2) for 28 days) and HX + CLQ (given 50 mg/kg and 10% O(2) for 28 days). After the experiment, blood samples and testicular tissues were taken. Histopathological evaluation was performed on testicular tissues and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1-α), heat shock proteins (HSPs) HSP70, HSP90 and growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153) expression levels were detected via immunohistochemistry. Moreover, apoptotic cells were detected via terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining and serum testosterone levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. Histopathological changes, apoptotic cell numbers and HIF1-α, HSP70, HSP90 and GADD153 expressions significantly increased in HX group (P &lt;.05). Moreover, serum testosterone levels decreased in this group (P &gt;.05). However, CLQ exerted a strong ameliorative effect on all parameters in HX + CLQ group. According to our results, we suggested that CLQ can be considered as an alternative protective agent for eliminating the negative effects of hypoxic conditions on male fertility.</td>

      <td>Possible involvement of apoptosis in the antipsychotics side effects: A mini-review</td>
      <td>Antipsychotics are used in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. Generally, they are divided into typical and atypical ones, according to the fact that atypical antipsychotics induce fewer side effects and are more effective in terms of social and cognitive improvements. Their pharmacological effects are mediated via broad range of receptors that consequently influence different cellular signalling pathways. Antipsychotics produce undesirable side effects that range from relatively minor to life threatening. In vitro and in vivo studies have pointed to neurotoxic effect exerted by some antipsychotics and have shown that apoptosis might play role in some side effects induced by antipsychotics, including tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, agranulocytosis, osteoporosis, myocarditis, etc. Although cumulative data have suggested safety of atypical antipsychotics use during pregnancy, some of them have been shown to induce apoptotic neurodegenerative and structural changes in fetal brains with long-lasting impact on cognitive impairment of offspring. Typical antipsychotics seem to be more cytotoxic than atypical ones. Recently, epidemiological studies have shown lower incidence of cancer in schizophrenic patients that suggest the ability of antipsychotics to suppress risk of cancer development. Some antipsychotics have been reported to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce their apoptosis. Therefore, antipsychotics apoptotic effect may be used as a tool in the treatment of some types of cancer, especially in combinatorial therapies. In this mini-review, we focused on pro- and antiapoptotic or ‘Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde’ effects of antipsychotics, which can be involved in their side effects, as well as their promising therapeutic indications.</td>

No significant differences were observed in the cumulative incidences of liver-related mortality or liver transplantation (1-month, 18.45 vs. 14.01%, p = 0.368; 8-year, 39.74 vs. 34.24%, p = 0.298), and hepatocellular carcinoma development (5-year, 7.21 vs.13.17%, p = 0.994; 8-year, 11.60 vs.13.17%, p = 0.857) between the matched 260 ETV- and 65 TDF-treated patients, regardless of time points. Baseline MELD score (subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR): 1.063; 95% confidence interval (CI) of sHR: 1.016–1.112) and hepatic encephalopathy (sHR: 5.127; 95% CI sHR: 3.032–8.669) were independently associated with liver-related mortality or liver transplantation in the matched patients. Conclusions: ETV and TDF had comparable efficacy in the short- and long-term liver-related outcomes of decompensated CHB patients, and baseline liver reserve was associated with the outcomes.</td>

      <td>Neurological Manifestations of Scrub Typhus</td>
      <td>Purpose of Review: The occurrence of cases of scrub typhus is on the rise in South Asian and Southeast Asian countries. The present review discusses neurological complications following scrub typhus to appraise clinicians practicing in endemic regions about considering this treatable disease in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile illnesses, especially when accompanied with clinical neurological features. Recent Findings: While the association of aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and meningoencephalitis with scrub typhus is well known, more recently described neurological syndromes associated with scrub typhus include acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, various cranial nerve palsies, cerebellitis, cerebrovascular diseases including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, transverse myelitis, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, parkinsonism, and many more. Early diagnosis is key to successful treatment. While diagnostic confirmation is generally made by the detection of IgM antibody by either ELISA or indirect fluorescent antibody tests, conventional PCR using 56 kDa gene (cPCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP assay), as well as a newly introduced metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), are currently available for detection of Orientia tsutsugamushi infection in clinically suspected cases. Summary: Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. The cutaneous hallmark of the disease is the “eschar.” Scrub typhus results in multisystem involvement. Neurological compromise is present in about 20% of scrub typhus patients and affects both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The postulated underlying mechanisms include direct invasion of the organism, a vasculitis-like process, or an immune-mediated injury. Diagnosis of scrub typhus is confirmed by detection of O. tsutsugamushi IgM antibody in serum. Awareness among clinicians regarding the varied presentations of this disease is very important in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Co-infection with dengue and/or chickungunya viruses may occur in endemic regions. The history of an acute febrile illness preceding the neurological illness is crucial. A very careful search for the eschar is essential; however, the absence of the skin lesion cannot exclude the diagnosis of scrub typhus. Neurological manifestations mostly respond to doxycycline therapy.</td>

      <td>Comparison of Three-Dimensional Surgical System Versus Binocular Microscope for Clear Corneal Incision in Cataract Surgery</td>
      <td>Introduction: To compare surgical outcomes of 2.2 mm clear corneal incision (CCI) between a three-dimensional (3D) visualization system and traditional binocular microscope (BM) for phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation surgery. Methods: In this randomized controlled clinical study, 60 eyes with age-related cataracts were divided into two groups receiving cataract surgery using either a 3D vision system (n = 30 eyes) (3D group) or a binocular microscope (n = 30 eyes) (BM group). We recorded and statistically analyzed surgical parameters and pre- and postoperative ocular parameters. Primary outcomes included the change in endothelial cell density (ECD) and CCI architecture, and secondary outcomes comprised other ocular parameters and surgical parameters. All procedures complied with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Results: Of the 60 eyes randomly assigned between January 5, 2021, and May 9, 2021, 55 (26 eyes in the 3D group and 29 eyes in the BM group) were analyzed. The ECD loss rate was 8.1% in the 3D group and 12.3% in the BM group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Local detachment of Descemet’s membrane was seen in 50% (13 eyes, 3D group) and 51.6% (15 eyes, BM group), wound gaping at the endothelial side in 15.4% (four eyes, 3D group) and 10.3% (four eyes, BM group), gaping at the epithelial side in 11.5% (three eyes, 3D group) and 6.9% (two eyes, BM group), and misalignment of the incision in 3.4% (one eye, BM group) 1 day after surgery. These abnormalities improved with time. There was no difference between the 3D group and BM group in terms of other ocular parameters or surgical parameters before and after surgery. Conclusions: Using the 3D surgical system for phacoemulsification and IOL implantation surgery seems to result in similar ECD and CCI conditions as using a conventional binocular microscope. Trial Registration: The protocol was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04839250).</td>

      <td>Ensuring Product Stability – Choosing the Right Excipients</td>
      <td>The stability of pharmaceuticals is an important product quality attribute. Of the known factors affecting stability, moisture is often perceived as the most common cause of drug degradation by hydrolysis or other reactions facilitated by moisture as a medium. Excipients are a critical entity in formulations to enable drug delivery as well as efficient manufacture of pharmaceutical dosage forms. Yet to this end, there is limited application and understanding of the role of excipients in protecting moisture sensitive drugs. An improved understanding of moisture-excipient interactions is important when selecting excipients for formulations containing moisture sensitive drugs. This review outlines the role of excipients as a moisture protectant in oral solid dosage forms. It focuses on the moisture interactions of excipients in order to highlight the potential of certain excipients as moisture protectants. More specifically, the mechanisms by which excipients can reduce drug degradation (e.g. acting as a physical barrier, reducing moisture availability and mobility) are discussed. A summary of analytical tools to evaluate moisture-excipient interactions is also provided.</td>

The optimal growth conditions for this isolate, a facultatively anaerobic bacterium, were 37 °C and pH 8.0. The cell-wall peptidoglycan type was B2γ, with 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DAB) as the diamino acids, while the major menaquinone was MK-12. The polar lipid profile was composed of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, unidentified phospholipids, unidentified glycolipids and an unidentified lipid. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0) and iso-C(16:0). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain GA224(T) fell within the genus Microcella. The draft genome of strain GA224(T) comprised 2,495,189 bp with a G + C content of 72.2 mol%. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain GA224(T) and the type strain of the type species of Microcella species were lower than 95% and 70%, respectively. Based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genomic data, strain GA224(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Microcella aerolata sp. nov. is proposed, with GA224(T) as the type strain (= GDMCC 1.2165( T) = JCM 34462( T)).</td>

Methods: Each E. anophelis-positive microbiological sample was considered a case. All patients were hospitalized in an infectious diseases unit. Clinical, environmental, and microbiological investigations (MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, PCR, E-test) were performed for each case. Results: Twenty cases were reported from September 2020 to September 2021, mainly community-acquired infections, responsible for nine deaths. The phylogenetic analysis showed a clonal origin and excluded nosocomial transmission. Despite the analysis of multiple environmental specimens, no source of contamination was identified. All strains were highly resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and imipenem. Conclusions: Clinicians and microbiologists should be aware of this multidrug-resistant bacterium, capable of causing severe infections. Most strains showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration values for cotrimoxazole and ciprofloxacin, making them the best choice for empirical antibiotic therapy.</td>

      <td>Background: Optimized antibiotic plasma predictor efficacy is essential in systemic infections. The uricosuric agent probenecid inhibits tubular excretion of antibiotics and may be used as β-lactam pharmacokinetic enhancer (BLPKE), even though few data are currently available for this purpose. Methods: We conducted a monocentric and retrospective observational study including all patients who received probenecid in combination with parenteral β-lactam antibiotics for systemic infections from Jan 1, 2014 to Dec 31, 2019. Demographics, infection characteristics, treatment and ATC (antibiotics trough concentration) were investigated. Results: All in all, 38 patients were included. Eight patients had a history of sickle cell disease. Hyperfiltration (defined as eGFR &gt; 130 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was detected in twenty-one patients including six with sickle cell disease. Probenecid (500 mg q6 h orally) was added to antibiotics for a median (IQR) of 13 days (6.75–21.75), after a median (IQR) time lapse of 7 days (4–16) following the initiation of antibiotics. Probenecid was administered for low antibiotic trough concentration in 29 patients, for increased renal clearance in 5 patients and for persisting fever despite antibiotic therapy in 4 patients (including 1 infective relapse). A second plasma trough concentration, following probenecid administration, was available in 19 patients within a median (IQR) 3 days (2–5). Probenecid induced increased ATC in 18/19 patients (94.7%), with a median (IQR) change of +228.4% (IQR 38.7–633). No major adverse effects were reported. Conclusion: Probenecid could be a BLPKE. Our data suggest this drug should be used more often to optimize β-lactam pharmacokinetics in clinical practice.</td>

      <td>Liver biopsy of chronic hepatitis B patients indicates HBV integration profile may complicate the endpoint and effect of entecavir treatment</td>
      <td>Aims: Viral integration profiles attract increased interest in the study of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but their features in the early stage of infection and changes due to antiviral treatments remain largely unknown. Methods: Liver biopsies and paired blood samples were obtained from HBeAg-positive patients before and after 48 weeks of entecavir treatment, and a probe-based capture strategy was applied for analyzing the HBV integrations in these samples. Serum HBV markers, including viral DNA, pgRNA, and HBsAg, were longitudinally assessed. Results: Entecavir treatment successfully reduced the levels of ALT, AST, and HBV serological markers (HBeAg, HBV pgRNA, and HBV DNA) in all patients (&lt;40 years old). As expected, HBV integrations contributed to HBsAg production, with the total number of integrations positively correlated with serum HBsAg level (r = 0.47, P = 0.04). Along with repressed HBV replication, the number of viral integrations in liver biopsies decreased by about 1.94-fold after ETV treatment, with viral breakpoints significantly enriched within nt 1600–1900 of the HBV genome. No recurrent events were observed both at baseline and after treatment for the same individual, and only one same integration was found in two patients. Unlike in tumors, integrations in CHB biopsies seemed to have no chromosomal preference. Moreover, CHB integrations demonstrated lower enrichment scores for open active states than tumors, such as DNase, TssA, and ZNF/Rpts, and the scores reduced after ETV treatment. The antiviral therapy led to the disappearance of the enrichment tendency of integrations in both open chromatin and heterochromatin regions. Conclusion: Reduced HBV replications by the nucleoside analogue may lead to decreased viral integrations in the liver, and those contributing to the HBsAg production may consistently occur. The pattern of HBV integration after ETV treatment is more random and irregular, which may contribute to a reduced risk of liver cancer due to antiviral treatment.</td>

      <td>Antibiotic resistance genes and their links with bacteria and environmental factors in three predominant freshwater aquaculture modes</td>
      <td>Rapid development of aquaculture industry and increasing demand of various inputs (especially antibiotics), are suspected to promote the occurrence and spread of ARGs in aquaculture related environments. However, the occurrences of ARGs under different freshwater aquaculture practices are rarely known. Here, we investigated the seasonal profiles of the main ARGs, intI1 and bacteria in waters from three kinds of predominant freshwater aquaculture practices around the Honghu Lake (China), as well as their co-occurrences and interrelationships with antibiotics, heavy metals and general water quality. The results indicate that quinolone resistance genes (qnrB), tetracycline resistance genes (tetB and tetX) and sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1 and sul2) were the top five predominant ARGs with seasonal variations of abundance. Fish ponds were of the highest absolute abundances of tested ARGs than the other two modes. Crayfish ponds and their adjacent ditches shared similar ARGs profile. Different subtypes of ARGs belonging to the same class of resistance were varied in abundances. Some bacteria were predicted to carry different ARGs, which indicating multi-antibiotic resistances. Moreover, the combined environmental factors (antibiotics, heavy metals and water quality) partially shaped the profiles of ARGs and bacteria composition. Overall, this study provides new comprehensive understanding on the characterization of ARGs contamination in different freshwater aquaculture practices from the perspectives of environmental chemistry, microbiology and ecology. The results would benefit the optimization of aquaculture practices toward environmental integrity and sustainability.</td>

      <td>Background In South Africa, male urethritis syndrome (MUS) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) syndrome in men. We determined the distribution of STI etiologies and the susceptibility profiles of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from men presenting with MUS to 3 sentinel surveillance health care facilities. Secondary objectives were to determine the seroprevalence of coinfections (HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex virus 2). Methods Consecutive, consenting men with symptomatic urethral discharge were enrolled between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Genital discharge swab and blood specimens were collected and transported to a central STI reference laboratory in Johannesburg, South Africa. Results Among 769 men enrolled, N. gonorrhoeae was the commonest cause of MUS (674 [87.8%]; 95% confidence interval [CI], 85.2%-89.9%), followed by Chlamydia trachomatis (161 [21.0%]; 95% CI, 18.2%-24.0%). Of 542 cultivable N. gonorrhoeae isolates, all were susceptible to ceftriaxone (modal minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.004 mg/L) and azithromycin (modal minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.128 mg/L). Seroprevalence rates of HIV, syphilis, and HSV-2 were 21.4% (95% CI, 18.5%-24.5%), 2.3%, and 50.1%, respectively. Condom use at last sexual encounter was reported by only 7%, less than 50% had been medically circumcised, and only 66.7% (58 of 87) who self-reported an HIV-positive status were adherent on antiretroviral drugs. Conclusions Neisseria gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis were the predominant causes of MUS. Currently recommended dual ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy are appropriate for MUS syndromic management; however, surveillance must be maintained to timeously detect emerging and increasing gonococcal resistance. Clinic-based interventions must be intensified in men seeing sexual health care to reduce the community transmission and burden of STI and HIV.</td>

      <td>Introduction: Infection-related glomerulonephritis (IRGN) is an immunologically mediated renal injury due to non-renal infections. With time there has been a change with respect to its incidence, etiological agents, clinical features, and outcomes. Materials and methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted from May 1, 2018 to May 31, 2021. Objectives: 1. To study the clinical profile of patients with renal biopsy-proven IRGN. 2. To study the outcomes of IRGN at the end of 3 months. All patients were followed up for a minimum period of 3 months. Outcomes at the end of 3 months were categorized as any one of the following: (1) normalization of renal function tests and proteinuria &lt; 500 mg/day, (2) persistent renal dysfunction without requirement of renal replacement therapy, (3) requirement of renal replacement therapy. Results: A total of 114 patients were included in the study. The incidence of IRGN was 4.6%. The majority were males and in the fifth decade of life. Focus of infection was identified in 59.6% of cases. Acute glomerulonephritis (35.1%) and nephrotic syndrome (35.1%) were the most common syndromic presentations. 68.4% of patients had complete recovery at the end of 3 months. 15.7% of patients progressed to chronic kidney disease, and 15.7% of patients required renal replacement therapy. Elderly patients' requirement of renal replacement therapy and higher creatinine at presentation were significantly associated with poor outcomes (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: This study emphasizes the need for early identification of the source of infection and treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Strategies to identify occult sources of infection should be employed. Elderly age and requirement of renal replacement therapy were associated with poor outcomes.</td>

      <td>Objectives: To prospectively describe the epidemiology and long-term outcome of childhood-acquired hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in a large cohort of children followed at a single center. Methods: All children with chronic HCV infection followed at the Liver Unit of our tertiary Hospital in Florence (Italy) from January 1, 1988, to September 30, 2021, were included in the analysis. Results: The final sample consisted of 163 children (median age at enrollment 4 years, interquartile range (IQR): 10; median age at last follow-up 14 years, IQR: 7). The median duration of follow-up was 86 months (IQR: 112). One hundred twenty-five children were vertically infected and 26 acquired the infection horizontally. Twenty-six of the 125 children who were vertically infected (20.8%) underwent spontaneous clearance of HCV RNA at a median age of 4 years (IQR: 2), whereas all the others remained persistently viremic. One patient was diagnosed with cirrhosis; 2 presented clinically detectable extrahepatic manifestations (chronic urticaria). Thirty-two children (19.6%) received antiviral therapy: 8 out of 32 (25%) were treated with pegylated-interferon alfa-2b [sustained virological response (SVR) 24 weeks after the end of treatment in 7/8]; 24 out of 32 (75%) were treated with direct-acting antivirals (SVR 12 weeks after the end of treatment in 23/24). Conclusions: The present study describes the largest cohort of children with chronic HCV infection prospectively evaluated with a long follow-up at a single center.

      <td>Cholangioscopy in Children and Adolescents: Utilization, Outcomes, and Safety</td>
      <td>Background: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is increasingly utilized for management of biliary disorders in children and adolescents. Practice patterns surrounding cholangioscopy in pediatric patients, however, are largely uncharacterized. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed all ERCPs in which cholangioscopy was performed on patients 18 and under at our tertiary care children's hospital from 2015 to 2020 using our institution's paper and electronic medical record system. Patient demographics, procedure indications, interventions, and associated adverse events were analyzed. Results: Over the study period, 307 ERCPs were performed on 282 patients at our children's hospital. Cholangioscopy was performed in 36 procedures (11.7%) using the SpyGlass cholangioscope (Boston Scientific). Antibiotics to cover biliary organisms were administered to all patients precholangioscopy. Mean patient age was 13.6 years (range 7-18 years). The 2 most common indications for cholangioscopy included electrohydraulic lithotripsy for biliary stone disease and evaluation of biliary stricture (with incidental finding of biliary web in 2 patients and retained suture material in 2 patients). Adverse events were less prevalent in patients who underwent cholangioscopy relative to those who underwent ERCP. 0/36 (0%) developed post-ERCP pancreatitis, one patient had self-limited melena (possible self-limited postsphincterotomy bleeding). Patient care was enhanced by cholangioscopy in 30/36 (83.3%) of these patients. Conclusions: These data attest to the safety and clinical utility of cholangioscopy in children and adolescents. Cholangioscopy was performed in just over 11% of pediatric patients who underwent ERCP at our academic medical center - rates similar to those reported in adult patients. The radiation-sparing nature of cholangioscopy, coupled with these data supporting its safety, make it particularly appealing for use in children. Further multi-institution evaluation of the utility, safety, and range of indications for cholangioscopy in other practice settings would be of great interest and help guide endoscopic care.</td>

      <td>Fungal infection exacts a severe burden on patients with acute leukaemia. Azole prophylaxis attempts to mitigate this impact but is associated with toxicity and cost as well as the potential to select for resistance. The development of biomarkers including galactomannan and β-1,3-d-glucan may improve detection of early disease and thus reduce the need for prophylaxis, though these assays also have their limitations. In this debate, Howard et al. argue in favour of continuing chemoprophylaxis in patients with acute leukaemia receiving systemic chemotherapy, citing the multiple randomized control trials and meta-analyses that demonstrate its efficacy. Taynton et al. argue that fungal biomarker surveillance in the absence of primary antifungal chemoprophylaxis is a safe alternative that could reduce antifungal use and the development of resistance.</td>

      <td>Purpose: We present the case of a 56-year-old man with stage IV sarcoidosis on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) support for the management of respiratory failure receiving treatment with isavuconazole for invasive aspergillosis. Summary: VV-ECMO is an increasingly utilized life support therapy for patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure, but its impact on medication dosing is poorly understood. In our patient with invasive Aspergillus infection receiving VV-ECMO, because of difficulty achieving therapeutic serum concentrations of voriconazole, we administered isavuconazole 372 mg intravenously (IV) every 8 hours for 6 doses followed by 372 mg IV once daily. Isavuconazole has a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile compared to other azole antifungal agents, but its high protein binding and lipophilicity raise concerns about drug sequestration in the VV-ECMO circuit. To optimize the efficacy and safety of this treatment, the isavuconazole trough concentration was measured at days 5 and 17, at which time it was 1.7 and 0.7 μg/mL, respectively. The dose was subsequently increased to 744 mg IV once daily, and serum trough concentrations were measured 5 and 8 days after dose adjustment, corresponding to 3.7 and 2.9 μg/mL, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the third report to describe inadequate isavuconazole trough concentrations during VV-ECMO support when utilizing standard doses. Conclusion: In the case described here, standard-dose isavuconazole (372 mg every 8 hours for 6 doses followed by 372 mg daily) did not achieve target trough concentrations in a patient receiving concomitant ECMO support.</td>

      <td>Purpose: To evaluate and compare antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) guideline adherence (primary outcome) as well as length of stay, 30-day all-cause mortality, clinical cure, antimicrobial consumption, and incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens (secondary outcomes) between an infectious diseases (ID) pharmacist-led intervention group and a standard ASP group. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was performed at Thammasat University Hospital between August 2019 and April 2020. Data including baseline characteristics and primary and secondary outcomes were collected from the electronic medical record by the ID pharmacist. Results: The ASP guideline adherence in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group was significantly higher than in the standard ASP group (79% vs 56.6%; P &lt; 0.001), especially with regard to appropriate indication (P &lt; 0.001), dosage regimen (P = 0.005), and duration (P = 0.001). The acceptance rate of ID pharmacist recommendations was 81.8% (44/54). The most common key barriers to following recommendations were physician resistance (11/20; 55%) and high severity of disease in the patient (6/20; 30%). Compared to the standard ASP group, there was a trend toward clinical cure in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group (63.6% vs 56.1%; P = 0.127), while 30-day all-cause mortality (15.9% vs 1.5%; P = 0.344) and median length of stay (20 vs 18 days; P = 0.085) were similar in the 2 groups. Carbapenem (P = 0.042) and fosfomycin (P = 0.014) consumption declined in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group. A marginally significant decrease in the overall incidence of MDR pathogens was also observed in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group (coefficient, -5.93; P = 0.049). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that an ID pharmacist-led intervention can improve ASP guideline adherence and may reduce carbapenem consumption.</td>

      <td>Purpose: While some guidelines recognize the need for β-lactam therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), there is still a paucity of data regarding the prevalence of and barriers to performing β-lactam TDM in the United States. We sought to estimate the prevalence of β-lactam TDM, describe monitoring practices, and identify actual and perceived barriers to implementation among health systems in the US. Methods: A multicenter, cross-sectional, 40-item electronic survey was distributed to all postgraduate year 2 (PGY2) infectious diseases (ID) pharmacy residency program directors (RPDs) listed in the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists pharmacy residency directory. The primary outcome was the percentage of institutions with established β-lactam TDM. Secondary outcomes included assessing β-lactam TDM methods and identifying potential barriers to implementation. Results: The survey was distributed to 126 PGY2 ID RPDs, with a response rate of 31.7% (40 of 126). Only 8% of respondents (3 of 39) performed β-lactam TDM. Patient populations, therapeutic targets, and frequency and timing of obtaining repeat β-lactam concentration measurements varied among institutions. The greatest barrier to implementation was lack of access to testing with a rapid turnaround time. Institutions were unlikely to implement β-lactam TDM within the next year but were significantly more inclined to do so within 5 years (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: β-lactam TDM was infrequently performed at the surveyed US health systems. Lack of access to serum concentration testing with rapid turnaround and lack of US-specific guidelines appear to be considerable barriers to implementing β-lactam TDM. Among institutions that have implemented β-lactam TDM, there is considerable variation in monitoring approaches.</td>

      <td>Background/Objective This post hoc analysis assessed efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) golimumab in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients with early disease (ED) versus late disease (LD). Methods The phase 3, double-blind, GO-ALIVE study randomized patients to IV golimumab 2 mg/kg at weeks 0 and 4 and then every 8 weeks through week 52, or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 12 with crossover to IV golimumab at week 16. Clinical efficacy was assessed by ≥20% improvement in Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society response criteria (ASAS20), ≥50% improvement in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI 50), and Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) &lt;1.3 (inactive disease). Using self-reported duration of inflammatory back pain (IBP), patients were grouped into quartiles: first = ED and fourth = LD. Descriptive statistics summarized efficacy and safety findings through 1 year. Results Early disease patients (n = 60) were 10 years younger and had shorter median AS (IBP) symptom duration (2-3 years) versus LD patients (n = 52; 21-24 years). At week 16, numerically higher proportions of golimumab- than placebo-treated patients achieved ASAS20 (ED: 71% vs. 32%; LD: 67% vs. 21%), BASDAI 50 (ED: 40% vs. 12%; LD: 33% vs. 7%), and ASDAS &lt;1.3 (ED: 17% vs. 4%; LD 8% vs. 0%) regardless of IBP duration. Efficacy was durable through 1 year of treatment; however, response rates were numerically higher in patients with ED versus LD. Through week 60, adverse events and serious adverse events, respectively, were reported by 46% and 3% of ED patients and 61% and 2% of LD patients. Conclusion Prompt diagnosis of AS and early treatment with IV golimumab may yield more robust improvements in disease activity.</td>

The results showed that the remarkable inhibition of the bacterial as well as fungal growth was shown against the tested organisms. The phytochemical analyses of the plant extracts indicated the presence of saponins, tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, triterpenoids, steroids, glycosides, anthraquinones, coumarin, saponins, gum, protein, and amino acids. The antimicrobial activity of AWE and BAE may be due to the presence of such secondary metabolites.

      <td>Introduction &amp; importance: Enterobius vermicularis is the most common parasitic infection in developed countries of temperate and cool climates.The feco-oral route is the most common route of human infection. Due to obstruction of appendiceal lumen, the presence of parasites in the appendix may cause appendiceal colic or cause inflammation of the appendix. Case presentation: A 17 years old male was referred to our Emergency Department with acute abdominal pain in his right lower quadrant. The physical and laboratory examination revealed right iliac fossa tenderness and leukocytosis with neutophilia. An open appendectomy was performed. The lumen of appendix was filled with pinworms and were moved out of the appendiceal lumen. Postoperatively, one oral dose of 100 mg of mebendazole was administered to our patient and his family members and was repeated after 14 days. Conclusion: Infrequently the E. vermicularis can be found in appendectomy pathological specimens. Rarely, acute appendicitis caused by parasitic infections, especially in adults. So the clinical signs of intestinal parasite infection can be may mimic acute appendicitis. A careful evaluation of symptoms such as pruritus ani, or eosinophilia on laboratory examination, could prevent unnecessary appendectomies.</td>

      <td>Staphylococcus aureus in Non–Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis Prevalence and Genomic Basis of High Inoculum b-Lactam Resistance</td>
      <td>Rationale: The pathobiology of Staphylococcus aureus in non–cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (nCFB) is poorly defined. When present at high density or “inoculum,” some methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) can inefficiently degrade antistaphylococcal b-lactam antibiotics via BlaZ penicillinases (termed the “inoculum effect” [IE]). Given the high burden of organisms in bronchiectatic airways, this is particularly relevant. Objectives: Drawing from a prospectively collected biobank, we sought to understand the prevalence, natural history, potential for transmission, and antibiotic resistance profiles among nCFB-derived MSSA isolates. Methods: All individuals attending a regional consultancy nCFB clinic with sputum collected between 1981 and 2017 were considered, and those with one or more S. aureus–positive cultures composed the cohort. Each individual’s most recent biobank isolate was subjected to whole-genome sequencing (including the blaZ gene), antibacterial susceptibility testing, and comparative b-lactam testing at standard (5 3 10(5) colony-forming unit [cfu]/ml) and high (5 3 10(7) cfu/ml) inocula to assess for the IE and pronounced IE. Results: Seventy-four (35.4%) of 209 individuals had one or more sputum samples with S. aureus (68 MSSA, 6 methicillin-resistant S. aureus). Those with S. aureus infection were more likely to be female. Among 60 of 74 MSSA isolates subjected to whole-genome sequencing, no evidence of transmission was identified, although specific multilocus sequence typing types were prevalent, including ST-1, ST-15, ST-30, and ST-45. Antibiotic resistance was uncommon, except for macrolides (~20%). Among the 60 MSSA samples, the prevalence of IE and pronounced IE was observed to be drug specific: meropenem (0% and 0%, respectively), cefepime (3% and 5%, respectively), ceftazidime (8% and 0%, respectively), cloxacillin (12% and 0%, respectively), cefazolin (23% and 0%, respectively), and piperacillin-tazobactam (37% and 17%, respectively). The cefazolin IE was associated with blaZ type A (P, 0.01) and ST-30 (P, 0.01), whereas the piperacillin-tazobactam IE was associated with type C blaZ (P, 0.001) and ST-15 (P, 0.05). Conclusions: S. aureus infection was common, although no evidence of transmission was apparent in our nCFB cohort. Although routine susceptibility testing did not identify significant resistance, inoculum-related resistance was found to be relevant for commonly used nCFB antibiotics, including cefazolin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Given previous associations between IEs and negative patient outcomes, further work is warranted to understand how this phenotype impacts nCFB disease progression.</td>

      <td>Aims While the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may be contained through vaccination, transfusion of convalescent plasma (CCP) from individuals who recovered from COVID-19 (CCP) is considered an alternative treatment. We investigate if CCP transfusion in patients with severe respiratory failure increases plasma titres of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and improves clinical outcomes. Methods Patients with COVID-19 (n=34) were consented for CCP transfusion and serial blood draws pretransfusion and post-transfusion. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 antireceptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and IgM titres were measured by ELISA serially, and compared with serial plasma titre levels from control patients (n=68). The primary outcome was survival at 30 days, and secondary outcomes were length of ventilator and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and in the intensive care unit (ICU). Outcomes were compared with matched control patients (n=34). Kinetics of antibodies and clinical outcomes were compared using LOess regression and ORs, respectively. Results Prior to CCP transfusion, 74% of patients were anti-RBD seropositive for IgG (median 1:3200), and 81% were anti-RBD IgM seropositive (median 1:320), while 16% were seronegative. The kinetics of antibody titres in CCP recipients were similar to controls. CCP recipients presented with similar survival, duration on ventilatory and/or ECMO support, as well as ICU and hospital LOS compared with controls. Conclusions CCP transfusion did not increase the kinetics of SARS-CoV2 antibodies and did not result in improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 with severe respiratory failure, suggesting that CCP may not be indicated in this category of patients.</td>

We hypothesised that azithromycin, given three times weekly to infants with cystic fibrosis from diagnosis until age 36 months, would reduce the extent of structural lung disease as captured on chest CT scans. METHODS: A phase three, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done at eight paediatric cystic fibrosis centres in Australia and New Zealand. Infants (aged 3-6 months) diagnosed with cystic fibrosis following newborn screening were eligible. Exclusion criteria included prolonged mechanical ventilation in the first 3 months of life, clinically significant medical disease or comorbidities other than cystic fibrosis, or macrolide hypersensitivity. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either azithromycin (10 mg/kg bodyweight orally three times per week) or matched placebo until age 36 months. Randomisation was done with a permuted block strategy and an interactive web-based response system, stratified by study site. Unblinding was done once all participants completed the trial. The two primary outcomes were the proportion of children with radiologically defined bronchiectasis, and the percentage of total lung volume affected by disease. Secondary outcomes included clinical outcomes and exploratory outcomes were inflammatory markers. Analyses were done with the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01270074). FINDINGS: Between June 15, 2012, and July 10, 2017, 281 patients were screened, of whom 130 were enrolled, randomly assigned, and received first study dose. 68 participants received azithromycin and 62 received placebo. At 36 months, 88% (n=50) of the azithromycin group and 94% (n=44) of the placebo group had bronchiectasis (odds ratio 0·49, 95% CI 0·12 to 2·00; p=0·32), and total airways disease did not differ between groups (median difference -0·02%, 95% CI -0·59 to 0·56; p=0·96). Secondary outcome results included fewer days in hospital for pulmonary exacerbations (mean difference -6·3, 95% CI -10·5 to -2·1; p=0·0037) and fewer courses of inhaled or oral antibiotics (incidence rate ratio 0·88, 95% CI 0·81 to 0·97; p=0·0088) for those in the azithromycin group. For the preplanned, exploratory analysis, concentrations of airway inflammation were lower for participants receiving azithromycin, including interleukin-8 (median difference -1·2 pg/mL, 95% CI -1·9 to -0·5; p=0·0012) and neutrophil elastase activity (-0·6 μg/mL, -1·1 to -0·2; p=0·0087) at age 36 months, although no difference was noted between the groups for interleukin-8 or neutrophil elastase activity at 12 months. There was no effect of azithromycin on body-mass index at age 36 months (mean difference 0·4, 95% CI -0·1 to 0·9; p=0·12), nor any evidence of pathogen emergence with the use of azithromycin. There were few adverse outcomes with no differences between the treatment groups. INTERPRETATION: Azithromycin treatment from diagnosis of cystic fibrosis did not reduce the extent of structural lung disease at 36 months of age; however, it did reduce airway inflammation, morbidity including pulmonary exacerbations in the first year of life and hospitalisations, and improved some clinical outcomes associated with cystic fibrosis lung disease. Therefore we suggest thrice-weekly azithromycin is a strategy that could be considered for the routine early management of paediatric patients with cystic fibrosis.

      <td>Case Report: Treatment of Severe Neuroretinitis and other Sequelae Associated with Cat Scratch Disease</td>
      <td>SIGNIFICANCE: Severe vision loss from Bartonella neuroretinitis can be best treated to improve visual outcomes with a combination of systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics. Topical ketorolac 0.5% and difluprednate 0.05% are presented as a new adjunct therapy to potentially improve visual outcomes. PURPOSE: This case illustrates severe posterior pole complications that can occur with cat scratch disease disseminated to the eye. Combination therapy with antibiotics and corticosteroids results in better visual outcomes. Topical treatment might further enhance visual outcome by preventing inflammatory damage without significant immunosuppression. CASE REPORT: A 17-year-old male teenager presented with right eye vision loss. He had been hospitalized 2 weeks prior for optic neuritis and treated with intravenous methylprednisolone. After 3 days, vision had improved from 20/200 to 20/40. After positive serology for Bartonella henselae was obtained, he was released and treated with oral rifampin, doxycycline, and prednisone. Sixteen days later, he regressed to 20/200, and many more ophthalmic complications were observed. After discontinuation of rifampin, oral prednisone was continued for an additional 2 weeks, and doxycycline was continued for approximately 3 weeks. Topical drops ketorolac 0.5% twice a day and difluprednate 0.05% four times a day were used for more than 6 weeks before tapering after vision returned to normal. CONCLUSIONS: Bartonella neuroretinitis associated with pre-retinal hemorrhage, vitritis, and subretinal hemorrhage can be successfully treated with a combination of systemic medications and topical drops. Monotherapy with doxycycline is effective and well tolerated. Rifampin can cause rapid metabolization and reduction in plasma levels of both prednisone and doxycycline and should be avoided with combined therapy. Oral prednisone and topical difluprednate are recommended to quell initial inflammation during the first few weeks. The anti-inflammatory effects of doxycycline and topical ketorolac used for longer duration may be beneficial in preventing tissue damage without systemic immunosuppression and result in better visual outcomes.</td>

      <td>Inhaled antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis</td>
      <td>Background: Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder in which abnormal mucus in the lungs is associated with susceptibility to persistent infection. Pulmonary exacerbations are when symptoms of infection become more severe. Antibiotics are an essential part of treatment for exacerbations and inhaled antibiotics may be used alone or in conjunction with oral antibiotics for milder exacerbations or with intravenous antibiotics for more severe infections. Inhaled antibiotics do not cause the same adverse effects as intravenous antibiotics and may prove an alternative in people with poor access to their veins. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives: To determine if treatment of pulmonary exacerbations with inhaled antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis improves their quality of life, reduces time off school or work, and improves their long-term lung function. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register. Date of the last search: 7 March 2022. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and WHO ICTRP for relevant trials. Date of last search: 3 May 2022. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials in people with cystic fibrosis with a pulmonary exacerbation in whom treatment with inhaled antibiotics was compared to placebo, standard treatment or another inhaled antibiotic for between one and four weeks. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected eligible trials, assessed the risk of bias in each trial and extracted data. They assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Authors of the included trials were contacted for more information. Main results: Five trials with 183 participants are included in the review. Two trials (77 participants) compared inhaled antibiotics alone to intravenous antibiotics alone and three trials (106 participants) compared a combination of inhaled and intravenous antibiotics to intravenous antibiotics alone. Trials were heterogenous in design and two were only available in abstract form. Risk of bias was difficult to assess in most trials but, for four out of five trials, we judged there to be a high risk from lack of blinding and an unclear risk with regards to randomisation. Results were not fully reported and only limited data were available for analysis. One trial was a cross-over design and we only included data from the first intervention arm. Inhaled antibiotics alone versus intravenous antibiotics alone. Only one trial (18 participants) reported a perceived improvement in lifestyle (quality of life) in both groups (very low-certainty evidence). Neither trial reported on time off work or school. Both trials measured lung function, but there was no difference reported between treatment groups (very low-certainty evidence). With regards to our secondary outcomes, one trial (18 participants) reported no difference in the need for additional antibiotics and the second trial (59 participants) reported on the time to next exacerbation. In neither case was a difference between treatments identified (both very low-certainty evidence). The single trial (18 participants) measuring adverse events and sputum microbiology did not observe any in either treatment group for either outcome (very low-certainty evidence). Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics versus intravenous antibiotics alone. Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics may make little or no difference to quality of life compared to intravenous antibiotics alone. None of the trials reported time off work or school. All three trials measured lung function, but found no difference between groups in forced expiratory volume in one second (two trials; 44 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or vital capacity (one trial; 62 participants). None of the trials reported on the need for additional antibiotics. Inhaled plus intravenous antibiotics may make little difference to the time to next exacerbation; however, one trial (28 participants) reported on hospital admissions and found no difference between groups. There is likely no difference between groups in adverse events (very low-certainty evidence) and one trial (62 participants) reported no difference in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms (very low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: We identified only low- or very low-certainty evidence to judge the effectiveness of inhaled antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis. The included trials were not sufficiently powered to achieve their goals. Hence, we are unable to demonstrate whether one treatment was superior to the other or not. Further research is needed to establish whether inhaled tobramycin may be used as an alternative to intravenous tobramycin for some pulmonary exacerbations.</td>

      <td>Loa loa is a filarial nematode responsible for loiasis, endemic to West-Central Africa south of the Sahara and transmitted by flies. This study reports a case of L. loa in the vitreous cavity of the eye of a young patient, along with an in-depth literature review. A 22-year-old woman from Cameroon who migrated from Cameroon to Italy was referred to the Emergency Ophthalmology Department at Policlinico di Bari in July 2021 with the presence of a moving parasite in the subconjunctiva of the left eye. A recent onset of a papular lesion on the dorsal surface of the right wrist and a nodular lesion in the scapular region were detected. L. loa filariasis was diagnosed based on anamnestic data, clinical and paraclinical signs, and a parasitological test confirming the presence of microfilariae in two blood samples collected in the morning of two different days. Because of the unavailability of diethylcarbamazine (DEC), albendazole (ALB) 200 mg twice daily was administered for 21 days. A mild exacerbation of pruritus occurred during treatment, but resolved with the use of an antihistamine. A single dose of 12 mg ivermectin was prescribed at the end of the treatment with albendazole. Unlike other endemic parasite infections, L. loa is not included in the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, because it is not mentioned in the WHO and CDC list of neglected tropical diseases. This can result in an overall risk of lack of attention and studies on loiasis, with lack of data on global burden of the disease.</td>

      <td>Novel Drug Delivery Systems to Improve the Treatment of Keratitis</td>
      <td>Keratitis is a disease characterized by inflammation of the cornea caused by different pathogens. It can cause serious visual morbidity if not treated quickly. Depending on the pathogen causing keratitis, eye drops containing antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral agents such as besiloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, voriconazol, econazole, fluconazole, and acyclovir are used, and these drops need to be applied frequently due to their low bioavailability. Studies are carried out on formulations with extended residence time in the cornea and increased permeability. These formulations include various new drug delivery systems such as inserts, nanoparticles, liposomes, niosomes, cubosomes, microemulsions, in situ gels, contact lenses, nanostructured lipid carriers, carbon quantum dots, and microneedles. Ex vivo and in vivo studies with these formulations have shown that the residence time of the active substances in the cornea is prolonged, and their ocular bioavailability is increased. In addition, in vivo studies have shown that these formulations successfully treat keratitis. However, it has been observed that fluoroquinolones are used in most of the studies; similar drug delivery systems are generally preferred for antifungal drugs, and studies for viral and acanthameba keratitis are limited. There is a need for new studies on different types of keratitis and different drug active substances. At the same time, proving the efficacy of drug delivery systems, which give promising results in in vivo animal models, with clinical studies is of great importance for progress in the treatment of keratitis.</td>

Ophthalmic examination and blood analysis revealed bilateral uveitis with a normal complete blood (cell) count and biochemistry panel. Symptomatic treatment was administered with no improvement observed and the dog returned 2 weeks later for assessment of a draining swelling of the left hind 4th digit. Clinical examination of thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound showed evidence of disseminated blastomycosis characterized by pulmonary lesions, and multifocal lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the draining lesion and cytological examination of an enlarged lymph node established diagnosis. The dog was started on a standard antifungal treatment protocol (itraconazole) but returned after 11 d of treatment with neurological signs including ataxia, paraparesis, left head tilt, and compulsive turning.

      <td>The half-life of a drug is the time taken for the blood level of the drug to fall by half, provided that no more doses of the drug are administered in the intervening period. Many psychotropic drugs and their active metabolites, if any, have very long half-lives that extend for 2 days or longer. Examples are chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, fluoxetine, vortioxetine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, penfluridol, donepezil, and memantine. Other drugs with long half-lives that psychiatrists may prescribe include levothyroxine and zonisamide. Psychotropic drugs with long half-lives take long to reach steady state; this is seldom a problem. They also take long to wash out; this is an advantage because the risk of drug withdrawal or discontinuation syndromes is small, and a disadvantage if rapid washout is desired for any reason, including the experience of drug adverse effects or toxicity, or the discovery of an unplanned pregnancy. Other clinical issues related to drugs with long half-lives include the relevance of occasional missed doses, the possibility of once-weekly dosing, and the need for pregnancy planning.</td>

      <td>Antibiotic Prescribing Patterns and Guideline Concordance for Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections Among Adult Women in the US Military Health System</td>
      <td>Importance: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most commonly diagnosed infections, and prior studies have reported discordance in antibiotic treatment with the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. Objective: To assess IDSA guideline concordance rates for women with uncomplicated UTIs treated with antibiotics, and compare concordance rates between different specialty field. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cross-sectional study of health care claims data from the US Military Health System Data Repository, which contains comprehensive health care encounter and claims data for all military beneficiaries. Participants were adult women between the ages of 18 to 50 years with uncomplicated UTIs from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2019. Data extraction and analysis were performed in 2022. Patients with diagnosis of UTI in the preceding 6 months, current pregnancy, history of pyelonephritis, history of diabetes, history of organ transplant, history of human immunodeficiency virus, immunosuppression, renal insufficiency, urinary tract abnormalities, or history of urologic procedures were excluded. Exposures: Antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated UTIs. Only antibiotics received within 1 day after the diagnosis were analyzed. The IDSA recommends the following antibiotics as first-line therapy: nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, pivmecillinam. Main Outcomes and Measures: The IDSA guideline concordance rates were calculated as the number of patients receiving first-line antibiotic therapy divided by the total number of cases for uncomplicated UTIs. Results: A total of 46 793 adult women (67.3% [31 475 of 46 793] aged 18-34 years; 38.2% [31 475 of 46 793] of White race) were diagnosed with uncomplicated UTIs with 91.0% receiving guideline-concordant antibiotic treatment. In comparison with obstetrics and gynecology, IDSA guideline-concordant treatment was more likely in internal medicine (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.87; 95% CI, 2.73-3.03), family medicine (aOR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.76-1.87), surgery (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.36-1.67), and emergency medicine (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.32-1.39) and less likely in urology (aOR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.38-0.43). Compared with direct military care, private sector care had lower concordance rates (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.62-0.64). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of antibiotic treatments for uncomplicated UTIs in a universally insured population, the IDSA guideline-concordance rate was high at 91.0% with higher rates in direct military care compared with private sector care. There were higher rates in general medical specialties, surgery, and emergency medicine and lower rates in urology and obstetrics and gynecology. These results further enhance the literature on current antibiotic prescribing practices for uncomplicated UTIs in adult women.</td>

      <td>Introduction. The New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) variant NDM-5 was first described in 2011 in an isolate of Escherichia coli. We noted that a high proportion of isolates of E. coli positive for blaNDM carbapenemase genes submitted to the UK Health Security Agency (formerly Public Health England) between 2019 and mid-2021 carried the blaNDM-5 allele, with many co-harbouring rmtB, rendering them highly resistant to aminoglycosides as well as to most β-lactams.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. This observation suggested that a common plasmid may be circulating.Aim. To compare these isolates and describe the plasmids carrying these resistance elements.Methodology. All isolates were sequenced on an Illumina platform, with five also subjected to long-read nanopore sequencing to provide complete assemblies. The locations of blaNDM-5, rmtB and other associated genetic elements were identified. Susceptibility testing to a wide range of antibiotics was carried out on representative isolates.Results. The 34 isolates co-harbouring blaNDM-5 and rmtB were from 14 hospital groups and six different regions across England and consisted of 11 distinct sequence types. All carried IncF plasmids. Assembly of the NDM plasmids in five isolates revealed that they carried rmtB and blaNDM-5 in an IncF conjugative plasmid ranging in size from 85.5 to 161 kb. All carried a highly conserved region, previously described in E. coli plasmid pHC105-NDM, that included blaTEM-1B and rmtB followed by sequence bounded by two IS26 elements containing ΔISAba125, blaNDM-5, ble, trpF and tat followed by ISCR1 and an integron with sul1, aadA2 and dfrA12 cassettes. This arrangement has been described in isolates from other countries and continents, suggesting that such plasmids are widely distributed, at least in E. coli, with similar plasmids also found in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Tested isolates were resistant to most antibiotics except colistin, fosfomycin and tigecycline.Conclusion. These observations suggest that conjugative plasmids carrying a highly conserved resistance gene segment have become widespread in England and elsewhere. This study highlights the value of routine whole-genome sequencing in identifying genetic elements responsible for resistance dissemination.</td>

Between May 2017 and September 2018, 55 Shigella flexneri 2a isolates were collected from 3322 stool samples of 0-10-year-old outpatients with diarrhea at the Children's Hospital of Urumqi, China. All isolates were characterized using serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and whole-genome sequencing. A total of 54 of 55 (98.2%) isolates exhibited MDR phenotypes and had accumulated multiple resistance determinants, particularly of fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins preferred for shigellosis treatment: point mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of topoisomerases (GyrA (S83L, D87N) and ParC (S80I) [n = 9]; GyrA (S83L) and ParC (S80I) [n = 45]) and acquisition of qnrS1 (n = 3) and blaCTX-M (n = 8). Over 70% of isolates acquired two point mutations of GyrA (S83L) and ParC (S80I) in QRDRs and 11 highly resistant isolates accumulated three point mutations in QRDRs or acquired qnrS1. Four S. flexneri 2a isolates from three single-nucleotide polymorphism clusters exhibited coresistance to ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, or azithromycin (AZM), which are used as first- and second-line shigellosis treatment antimicrobials in clinics. Our data indicated that fluoroquinolones should be terminated in shigellosis treatment for outpatients in Urumqi. The transferable antimicrobial resistance determinants have been identified for third-generation cephalosporins and AZM.

The yield was higher for the lignin of the branches (67.9 %) when compared to the leaves (60.2 %). Lignins are of the GSH type, low molecular weight and thermally stable. They promoted moderate to low antioxidant activity, highlighting the lignin of the branches, which presented an IC50 of 884.56 μg/mL for the DPPH assay and an IC50 of 14.08 μg/mL for ABTS. In the cytotoxicity assays, they showed low toxicity against macrophage cells (IC50 28.47 and 22.58 μg/mL). In addition, they were not cytotoxic against splenocytes and erythrocytes at concentrations ranging from 100 to 6.25 μg/mL. These were able to promote splenocyte proliferation and induce the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. And inhibit the growth of tumor cells with IC50 ranging from 12.63 to values &gt;100 μg/mL and microbial at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. Finally, they showed antiparasitic activity by inhibiting the growth of chloroquine-sensitive and resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. These findings reinforce that the lignins in this study are promising for potential pharmaceutical and biomedical applications.</td>

      <td>Microalgae-based biotechnology for antibiotic removal has received increasing attention as an economical and green method. This study investigated the removal mechanism of erythromycin by Chlorella pyrenoidosa and its correlation with the ecotoxic responses of microalgae. The degradation products (DPs) were identified, and their toxicity was predicted. The results indicated that only 4.04 %, 6.28 % and 23.53 % of erythromycin were left after 21-day microalgae treatment in 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mg/L treatments, respectively. Biodegradation contributed 48.62-67.01 %, 16.67-52.32 % and 6.42-24.82 %, while abiotic degradation contributed 8.76-29.61 %, 5.19-41.39 %, and 16.55-51.22 % to erythromycin attenuation in 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mg/L treatments, respectively. The growth and physiological-biochemical parameters of microalgae were slightly affected in low concentration treatment, which may be the main reason that biodegradation was the prominent removal mechanism. By contrast, oxidative damage in high concentration treatment inhibited the cell growth and chlorophyll content of microalgae, which hindered erythromycin biodegradation. In addition, eleven erythromycin degradation products (DPs) were identified during microalgae treatment of 21 days. Seven DPs including DP717, DP715, DP701A, DP701B, DP657, DP643, and DP557, represented higher toxicity to aquatic organisms than erythromycin.</td>

We test the hypothesis that the 5-HT 7 receptor possesses constitutive activity in a physiological situation. Isolated veins from male and female Sprague Dawley rats were used as models for measuring isometric force; the abdominal vena cava possesses a functional 5-HT 7 receptor that mediates relaxation, whereas the small mesenteric vein does not. Compounds reported to act as inverse agonists were investigated for their ability to cause contraction (moving a constitutively active relaxant receptor to an inactive state, removing relaxation). Compared with a vehicle control, clozapine, risperidone, ketanserin, and SB269970 caused no contraction in the isolated male abdominal vena cava. By contrast, methiothepin caused a concentration-dependent contraction of the male but not female abdominal vena cava, although with low potency (-log EC 50 [M] = 5.50 ± 0.45) and efficacy (∼12% of contraction to endothelin-1). Methiothepin-induced contraction was not reduced by the 5-HT 7 receptor antagonist (SB269970, 1 μM, not active in the vena cava). These same compounds showed little to no effect in the isolated mesenteric vein. We conclude that the 5-HT 7 receptor in the isolated veins of the Sprague Dawley rat does not possess constitutive activity. We raise the question of the physiological relevance of constitutive activity of this receptor important to such diverse physiological functions as sleep, circadian rhythm, temperature, and blood pressure regulation.</td>

      <td>Clinical utility of whole body diffusion-weighted imaging in an immunocompetent adult with atypical cat scratch disease</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Cat scratch disease (CSD) is an infectious disease caused by Bartonella henselae. CSD follows a typical course, characterized by regional lymphadenopathy. In atypical CSD, the lesions spread to systemic organs and can cause fever of unknown origin (FUO). A previous study showed the usefulness of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) without diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the diagnosis of FUO, but there are no studies on the clinical utility of whole-body DWI (WB-DWI). We herein report the case of an immunocompetent young man in whom contrast-enhanced CT-unidentifiable multiple liver abscess and osteomyelitis were successfully detected by WB-DWI. Follow up with a liver biopsy helped confirm an atypical CSD diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old previously healthy man was admitted for a 19-day history of high fever despite 3-day treatment by azithromycin. His physical examination was unremarkable and contrast-enhanced CT showed only a low attenuated area in the right lobe of the liver, indicating a cyst. WB-DWI revealed multiple nodular lesions of hypo-diffusion in the liver, spine, and pelvic region. The biopsy specimens of the liver abscess showed no evidence of tuberculosis/malignancy and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of liver abscess aspirate showed positive findings for B. henselae, confirming the diagnosis of CSD. He completed minocycline monotherapy for a total of 60 days without any deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: WB-DWI can be useful for the diagnosis of atypical CSD with hepatic and bone involvement, which can cause FUO in young immunocompetent adults.</td>

      <td>Inhibition or disruption of biofilms has been recognized as an important means to eradicate Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. However, a fast and efficient drug screening method against H. pylori biofilms has not yet been established. Therefore, AlpB, an important outer membrane protein in H. pylori biofilm formation, was selected as a biological recognition element to screen anti-biofilm drugs in this study. A novel AlpB/colloidal gold (CG)/nanoporous gold (NPG)/Nafion-reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/glassy carbon electrode (GCE) biosensor was constructed based on the heterologous expression of AlpB. The prepared AlpB-based biosensor not only successfully identified six anti-biofilm drugs, but also evaluated the sensitivity and action intensity of different anti-biofilm drugs binding to AlpB by interaction kinetics analysis. The sensitivity order of AlpB to the six anti-biofilm drugs was: allicin &gt; erythromycin &gt; SCC &gt; curcumin &gt; rifampicin &gt; NAC and the action intensity of the six anti-biofilm drugs on AlpB was: rifampicin &gt; NAC &gt; allicin &gt; erythromycin &gt; SCC &gt; curcumin. In addition, molecular docking results showed that the six anti-biofilm drugs might exert their anti-biofilm effects by spontaneously binding to the conserved region of AlpB protein. This study provided a rapid screening platform and a unified data processing method for potential anti-biofilm drug development.</td>

      <td>Interactions of Caenorhabditis elegans β-tubulins with the microtubule inhibitor and anthelmintic drug albendazole</td>
      <td>Parasitic nematodes are major human and agricultural pests, and benzimidazoles are amongst the most important broad-spectrum anthelmintic drug class used for their control. Benzimidazole resistance is now widespread in many species of parasitic nematodes in livestock globally and an emerging concern for the sustainable control of human soil-transmitted helminths. β-tubulin is the major benzimidazole target, although other genes may influence resistance. Among the 6 Caenorhabditis elegans β-tubulin genes, loss of ben-1 causes resistance without other apparent defects. Here, we explored the genetics of C. elegans β-tubulin genes in relation to the response to the benzimidazole derivative albendazole. The most highly expressed β-tubulin isotypes, encoded by tbb-1 and tbb-2, were known to be redundant with each other for viability, and their products are predicted not to bind benzimidazoles. We found that tbb-2 mutants, and to a lesser extent tbb-1 mutants, were hypersensitive to albendazole. The double mutant tbb-2 ben-1 is uncoordinated and short, resembling the wild type exposed to albendazole, but the tbb-1 ben-1 double mutant did not show the same phenotypes. These results suggest that tbb-2 is a modifier of albendazole sensitivity. To better understand how BEN-1 mutates to cause benzimidazole resistance, we isolated mutants resistant to albendazole and found that 15 of 16 mutations occurred in the ben-1 coding region. Mutations ranged from likely nulls to hypomorphs, and several corresponded to residues that cause resistance in other organisms. Null alleles of ben-1 are albendazole-resistant and BEN-1 shows high sequence identity with tubulins from other organisms, suggesting that many amino acid changes could cause resistance. However, our results suggest that missense mutations conferring resistance are not evenly distributed across all possible conserved sites. Independent of their roles in benzimidazole resistance, tbb-1 and tbb-2 may have specialized functions as null mutants of tbb-1 or tbb-2 were cold or heat sensitive, respectively.</td>

      <td>Atypical Splenic Abscesses Due to Clostridioides difficile</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND Splenic abscess is a rare infectious disease that occurs after bloodstream infection and trauma. It has become more common due to an increase in the number of immunocompromised patients. They typically present with round cystic lesions demonstrated by ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) is a well-known cause of pseudomembranous colitis, but extraintestinal manifestations are very rare. To the best of our knowledge, only 9 cases of splenic abscess due to C. difficile have been reported in the literature. CASE REPORT A 90-year-old man presented with weight loss, fever, and abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed splenomegaly with irregular hypodense nodules. Image-guided biopsy or drainage was not performed for a technical reason. MRI showed atypical nodules with mixed high and low signals on both T1- and T2-weighted images, which were inconclusive. A laparoscopic splenectomy was performed, which resulted in partial removal due to severe adhesion of the spleen to the surrounding tissues. Cultures of splenic pus yielded C. difficile, Enterococcus faecium, and Bacteroides fragilis. Pathological examination of the spleen showed widespread abscesses with hemorrhage and necrosis, leading to the diagnosis of splenic abscesses. Intravenous administration of vancomycin, clindamycin or metronidazole was ineffective. He died of fatal arrhythmia 5 months after the initial diagnosis of splenic abscess. CONCLUSIONS Splenic abscess can present with atypical imaging findings owing to chronic inflammation, bleeding, and necrosis. Although polymicrobial, this is the tenth reported case of splenic abscess caused by C. difficile.</td>

      <td>This study evaluates the use of the Global Pharma Health Fund (GPHF) Minilab for medicine quality screening by 16 faith-based drug supply organizations located in 13 low- and middle-income countries. The study period included the year before the COVID-19 pandemic (2019) and the first year of the pandemic (2020). In total 1,919 medicine samples were screened using the GPHF Minilab, and samples showing serious quality deficiencies were subjected to compendial analysis in fully equipped laboratories. Thirty-four (1.8%) of the samples were found not to contain the declared active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), or less than 50% of the declared API, or undeclared APIs, and probably represented falsified products. Fifty-four (2.8%) of the samples were reported as substandard, although the true number of substandard medicines may have been higher due to the limited sensitivity of the GPHF Minilab. The number of probably falsified products increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially due to falsified preparations of chloroquine; chloroquine had been incorrectly advocated as treatment for COVID-19. The reports from this project resulted in four international WHO Medical Product Alerts and several national alerts. Within this project, the costs for GPHF Minilab analysis resulted as 25.85 € per sample. Medicine quality screening with the GPHF Minilab is a cost-effective way to contribute to the global surveillance for substandard and falsified medical products.</td>

      <td>Evaluation of HIV-1 drug resistance among patients failing first-line antiretroviral therapy in Ethiopia</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate HIV-1 drug resistance among patients failing first-line antiretroviral therapy in Ethiopia. METHOD: A total of 699 HIV-infected adults (≥15 years) who failed first-line ART were recruited between 2017 and 2019 from 63 ART-providing sites in Ethiopia. Treatment failure was defined as patients with two consecutive viral loads ≥1000 copies/ml within 6 months of follow-up. The pol gene region of HIV-1 was amplified and sequenced using in-house assay of China CDC. The Stanford HIVDB v9.0 algorithm was used for identification of resistance mutations. Resistance mutations were characterized according to the 2019 International AIDS Society-USA mutation list. P-value of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant during multivariate analysis which was done using SPSS v26.0. RESULTS: Overall HIVDR among patients failing first-line therapy in Ethiopia was 77.8%. NNRTI and NRTI resistance was 75.7% and 71.2%, respectively. NVP and EFV accounted for 74.2% and 60.8% HIVDR, respectively. About half (48.1%) of NRTI associated mutations were responsible for Abacavir while 34% were for multi-NRTI resistance. Mutations responsible for the commonly used EFV and NVP accounted 62.9% while resistance to Etravirine, Doravirine and Rilivirine, which were not part of the country's ART program, were 37.1% and could be explained by cross-resistance within the drug class. PI associated resistance was detected only in 1.6% of the study participants. The most common mutations identified were M184V (30.1%), K103N (18.7%), Y181C (13.6%) and K65R (12.1%). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, predictors of HIVDR were prior ART exposure (AOR=2.3; 95%CI=1.8, 3.6), absence of HIV status disclosure (AOR=2.05; 95%CI=1.26, 3.35), CD4 count of ≤200 cells/mm3 (AOR= 1.94; 1.213, 3.125) and bedridden status (AOR=4.16; 95%CI=3.21, 5.16). CONCLUSIONS: The high-levels of HIVDR among patients with failure of first-line ART in Ethiopia calls for individualized HIVDR testing. Mutations associated with multi-NRTI and NNRTI cross-resistance may alert the program for considering drugs of higher genetic barrier targeting protease and other regions. Patients with low CD4 count and bedridden should be given attention for the potential HIVDR during the clinical management. KEY WORDS: ART; Cross-resistance; Drug resistance mutations; HIV-1.</td>

      <td>Rationale: Central nervous system infections (CNSIs) are one of the most serious complications after neurosurgery, especially carbapenem-resistant bacterial meningitis. Owing to the poor blood-brain barrier permeability of most antibiotics, the treatment of CNSIs by intraventricular (IVT) administration is becoming a hot topic in clinical research. Currently, the treatment of CNSIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is mainly based on intraventricular injection of an antibiotic combined with one or more other systemic intravenous (IV) antibiotics, whereas there are few case reports of intraventricular injection of 2 antibiotics. Patient concerns: A 57-year-old man with an open craniocerebral injury presented with dyspnea, high fever, and seizures associated with surgery. Diagnosis: Intracranial infection caused by carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae was diagnosed. Interventions: On the advice of a clinical pharmacist, the patient was given tigecycline (100 mg IV + 3 mg IVT q12h) combined with amikacin (0.8 g IV + 30 mg IVT qd) antiinfective therapy. Ultimately, the pathogens in the cerebrospinal fluid were eradicated after 7 days, and the CNSIs were completely cured after 14 days. Outcomes: The patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital without adverse reactions. Lessons: A series of in vitro and in vivo synergy tests of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae showed that tigecycline combined with aminoglycosides had good synergistic effects and effectively suppressed bacterial resistance selection. Intravenous plus intraventricular tigecycline-amikacin seems to be a safe and effective treatment option for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae CNSIs.</td>

      <td>The infection rate is high in patients injured at sea, and because of the unique distribution of marine microorganisms, the infection is often not easily controlled effectively with the empirical application of antibiotics. This study aims to consider the clinical characteristics and pathogen infection and drug susceptibility of patients injured at sea. From 2019 to 2021, there were 635 patients injured at sea in Rizhao People's Hospital. We assess the patient's basic condition, while performing bacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing on wound exudate or pus from infected patients. Among the 635 patients injured at sea, 195 people were infected, and the infection rate was 30.71%. Infected patients are usually older, have longer prehospital visits, and have lower normal levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, total protein, and albumin. The causes of injury in infected patients were mainly avulsion and puncture injuries, and the types of injuries were mainly bone fracture, vascular injury, and nerve injury. A total of 305 strains of pathogenic bacteria were cultured in 195 patients. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 77.05% (235 strains), of which Proteus was the most. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 22.95% (70 strains), of which Staphylococcus aureus was the most. Gram-negative bacilli were sensitive to aminoglycosides, lactam antibiotics, carbapenems antibiotics, sulfonamides, quinolones, fourth-generation cephalosporins, and antibacterial drugs containing enzyme inhibitors, while most of the bacteria were resistant to penicillins, first-generation cephalosporins, and second-generation cephalosporins. Gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to quinuptin/dafoptin, rifampicin, linezolid, gentamicin, tigacycline, and vancomycin but resistant to penicillin antibiotics. Due to the particularity of marine injuries, patients are prone to infection. Pathogen culture and drug sensitivity analysis play an important role in guiding antiinfective treatment for marine injured patients.</td>

      <td>Systemic Brucellosis with Arrhythmogenic Cardiac Inflammatory Pseudotumor</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND Cardiac inflammatory pseudotumors are rarely observed. Their etiology might include immunologic abnormalities, fibrogenetic disorders, specific reactions to infections or abnormalities related to trauma, necrosis, or neoplasm. Life-threatening ventricular tachycardia and cases of sudden death related to cardiac tumors have been reported. The present report describes and discusses diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for the treatment of nonsarcoid multiorgan pseudotumors with cardiac involvement. CASE REPORT A 38-year-old woman presented to the clinic with symptomatic ventricular tachycardia. As coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and channelopathy were ruled out, and electrocardiograms were not typical of idiopathic arrhythmia, the patient underwent detailed diagnostics which included targeted endomyocardial biopsy, which revealed a cardiac inflammatory pseudotumor. Laborious testing (and eventually, antibiotic therapy) led to ex juvantibus diagnosis of multiorgan disseminated brucellosis with cardiac involvement. Treatment with ceftriaxone, doxycycline, and rifampicin resulted in a complete resolution of all lesions after 3 months, and sustained recovery was observed during a 5-year follow-up. As the risk of ventricular tachycardia could not be reliably predicted, the patient had a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implanted. CONCLUSIONS A vast diagnostic armamentarium of modern medicine allowed us to diagnose an unsuspected and rare cardiac inflammatory pseudotumor. In the case of travelers, the possibility of regionally specific illnesses, especially infections, must be taken into consideration as possible causes of arrhythmias. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in patients with 'idiopathic ventricular tachycardias' to detect non-apparent myocardial lesions which may result from the underlying cause of the arrhythmia.</td>

      <td>PURPOSE: To describe a case of endogenous endophthalmitis (EE) following severe COVID-19 disease, review patient outcomes with EE following COVID-19 infection, review evidence regarding risk factors for developing EE. METHODS: Review of health records, imaging, intravitreal injection, and pars plana vitrectomy for bilateral fungal EE following severe COVID-19 disease. Literature review on outcomes in EE following COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: 63 year-old male with diabetes and hypertension was admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 disease for 3 months. His stay required ICU admission, intubation, high-dose corticosteroids, tocilizumab, and was complicated by bacteremia, empyema, and fungal esophagitis. He developed floaters and bilateral vision loss (visual acuity 20/40 OD, CF OS) with vitritis 2.5 months into his stay that did not respond to intravitreal voriconazole. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed for both eyes, resulting in visual acuity of 20/40 OD, 20/30 OS. Vitreous cultures were positive for candida albicans. EE following COVID-19 disease has been reported in 22 patients to date, and outcomes are poor, with 40%+ of eyes legally blind (20/200 or worse). Although influenced by availability of imaging modalities and degree of training of the evaluating physician, misdiagnosis can affect ¼ of cases, delaying treatment. Age, male gender, and diabetes increase risk of severe COVID-19, which requires prolonged hospitalization, invasive catheretization, and immunosuppression, which in turn increases risk of nosocomial infection. CONCLUSION: Low threshold for suspecting endogenous endophthalmitis in patients presenting with floaters and decreased vision following severe COVID-19 disease is necessary to ensure prompt recognition and treatment.</td>

      <td>Cell proliferation is tightly controlled by inhibitors that block cell cycle progression until growth signals relieve this inhibition, allowing cells to divide. In several tissues, including the liver, cell proliferation is inhibited at mitosis by the transcriptional repressors E2F7 and E2F8, leading to formation of polyploid cells. Whether growth factors promote mitosis and cell cycle progression by relieving the E2F7/E2F8-mediated inhibition is unknown. We report here on a mechanism of cell division control in the postnatal liver, in which Wnt/β-catenin signaling maintains active hepatocyte cell division through Tbx3, a Wnt target gene. The TBX3 protein directly represses transcription of E2f7 and E2f8, thereby promoting mitosis. This cascade of sequential transcriptional repressors, initiated by Wnt signals, provides a paradigm for exploring how commonly active developmental signals impact cell cycle completion.</td>

The advent of CRISPR-based genome editing technologies provides opportunities to investigate the genetics of important bacteria and transcend the lack of genetic tools in bifidobacteria to study the basis for their health-promoting attributes. Here, we repurpose the endogenous type I-G CRISPR-Cas system and adopt an exogenous CRISPR base editor for genome engineering in B. animalis subsp. lactis, demonstrating that both genomic and epigenetic contexts drive editing outcomes across strains. We reprogrammed the endogenous type I-G system to screen for naturally occurring large deletions up to 27 kb and to generate a 500-bp deletion in tetW to abolish tetracycline resistance. A CRISPR-cytosine base editor was optimized to install C•G-to-T•A amber mutations to resensitize multiple B. lactis strains to tetracycline. Remarkably, we uncovered epigenetic patterns that are distributed unevenly among B. lactis strains, despite their genomic homogeneity, that may contribute to editing efficiency variability. Insights were also expanded to Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis to emphasize the broad relevance of these findings. This study highlights the need to develop individualized CRISPR-based genome engineering approaches for distinct bacterial strains and opens avenues for engineering of next generation probiotics.</td>

      <td>Neuroprotective Drug Discovery From Phytochemicals and Metabolites for CNS Viral Infection: A Systems Biology Approach With Clinical and Imaging Validation</td>
      <td>Background: Recent studies have reported that pulmo-neurotropic viruses can cause systemic invasion leading to acute respiratory failure and neuroinfection. The tetracycline class of secondary metabolites of microorganisms is effective against several migrating neurotropic viral disorders, as Japanese-Encephalitis (JE), Severe-Acute-Respiratory-Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV2), Human-Immunodeficiency-Virus (HIV), and Simian-Immunodeficiency-Virus (SIV). Another microbial secondary metabolite, cephalosporin, can be used for anti-viral combination therapy. However, a substantial public health debacle is viral resistance to such antibiotics, and, thus, one needs to explore the antiviral efficiency of other secondary metabolites, as phytochemicals. Hence, here, we investigate phytochemicals like podophyllotoxin, chlorogenic acid, naringenin, and quercetin for therapeutic efficiency in neurotropic viral infections. Methods: To investigate the possibility of the afferent neural pathway of migrating virus in man, MRI scanning was performed on human subjects, whereby the connections between cranial nerves and the brain-stem/limbic-region were assessed by fiber-tractography. Moreover, human clinical-trial assessment (n = 140, p = 0.028) was done for formulating a quantitative model of antiviral pharmacological intervention. Furthermore, docking studies were performed to identify the binding affinity of phytochemicals toward antiviral targets as (i) host receptor [Angiotensin-converting Enzyme-2], (ii) main protease of SARS-COV2 virus (iii) NS3-Helicase/Nucleoside triphosphatase of Japanese-encephalitis-virus, and the affinities were compared to standard tetracycline and cephalosporin antibiotics. Then, network pharmacology analysis was utilized to identify the possible mechanism of action of those phytochemicals. Results: Human MRI-tractography analysis showed fiber connectivity, as: (a) Path-1: From the olfactory nerve to the limbic region (2) Path-2: From the peripheral glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerves to the midbrain-respiratory-center. Docking studies revealed comparable binding affinity of phytochemicals, tetracycline, and cephalosporin antibiotics toward both (a) virus receptors, (b) host cell receptors where virus-receptor binds. The phytochemicals effectively countered the cytokine storm-induced neuroinflammation, a critical pathogenic pathway. We also found that a systems-biology-based double-hit mathematical bi-exponential model accounts for patient survival-curve under antiviral treatment, thus furnishing a quantitative-clinical framework of secondary metabolite action on virus and host cells. Conclusion: Due to the current viral resistance to antibiotics, we identified novel phytochemicals that can have clinical therapeutic application to neurotropic virus infection. Based on human MRI scanning and clinical-trial analysis, we demarcated the anatomical pathway and systems-biology-based quantitative formulation of the mechanism of antiviral action.</td>

      <td>Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) is common hospital-acquired pneumonia in ICU patients. Patients with pneumonia after 48 hours of mechanical ventilation are VAP affected. INICC found that VAP rates between 2012 to 2017 are 14.1 per 1000 episodes.The most common pathogens include Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Developing countries seem to have a higher mortality rate compared to developed countries. Treatment protocol involves antibiotic therapy. For the early onset of VAP, cephalosporin (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone), fluoroquinolone, or piperacillin-tazobactam are found to be effective while for late-onset, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam seems to have positive results. Apart from antibiotics, other options like bacteriophage therapy can offer a good alternative to fight the rapid emergence of MDR pathogens.</td>

      <td>The microbicidal potential of visible blue light in clinical medicine and public health</td>
      <td>Visible blue light of wavelengths in the 400–470 nm range has been observed to have microbicidal properties. A widely accepted hypothesis for the mechanism of microbial inactivation by visible blue light is that the light causes photoexcitation of either endogenous (present within the microbe) or, exogenous (present in the biological medium surrounding the microbe) photosensitizers such as porphyrins and flavins, which leads to the release of reactive oxygen species that subsequently manifests microbicidal activity. Some of the factors that have been observed to be associated with enhanced microbicidal action include increased duration of exposure, and either pre- or co-treatment with quinine hydrochloride. In case of bacteria, repetitive exposure to the blue light shows no significant evidence of resistance development. Additionally, visible blue light has exhibited the ability to inactivate fungal and viral pathogens and, multidrug-resistant bacteria as well as bacterial biofilms. Visible blue light has demonstrated efficacy in eliminating foodborne pathogens found on food surfaces and exposed surfaces in the food processing environment as well as in the decontamination of surfaces in the clinical environment to minimize the spread of nosocomial infections. We conclude from reviewing existing literature on the application of the blue light in clinical medicine and public health settings that this microbicidal light is emerging as a safer alternative to conventional ultraviolet light-based technologies in multiple settings. However, further comprehensive studies and thorough understanding of the mechanism of microbicidal action of this light in different scenarios is warranted to determine its place in human health and disease.</td>

      <td>Background: COVID-19 patients with underlying medical conditions are vulnerable to drug-drug interactions (DDI) due to the use of multiple medications. We conducted a discovery-driven data analysis to identify potential DDIs and associated adverse events (AEs) in COVID-19 patients from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), a source of post-market drug safety. Materials and Methods: We investigated 18,589 COVID-19 AEs reported in the FAERS database between 2020 and 2021. We applied multivariate logistic regression to account for potential confounding factors, including age, gender, and the number of unique drug exposures. The significance of the DDIs was determined using both additive and multiplicative measures of interaction. We compared our findings with the Liverpool database and conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to validate the identified DDIs. Results: Out of 11,337 COVID-19 drug-Co-medication-AE combinations investigated, our methods identified 424 signals statistically significant, covering 176 drug-drug pairs, composed of 13 COVID-19 drugs and 60 co-medications. Out of the 176 drug-drug pairs, 20 were found to exist in the Liverpool database. The empirical p-value obtained based on 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations was less than 0.001. Remdesivir was discovered to interact with the largest number of concomitant drugs (41). Hydroxychloroquine was detected to be associated with most AEs (39). Furthermore, we identified 323 gender- and 254 age-specific DDI signals. Conclusion: The results, particularly those not found in the Liverpool database, suggest a subsequent need for further pharmacoepidemiology and/or pharmacology studies.</td>

      <td>Background: Chronic histiocytic intervillositis (CHI) is a rare placental lesion with a high recurrence rate and poor perinatal outcomes. There are currently limited guidelines regarding the diagnosis of this condition in the index pregnancy and treatment where recurrence is suspected. Objective: The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the perinatal outcomes of pregnancies affected by chronic histiocytic intervillositis and to what extent they can be improved with treatment. The secondary objective was to assess the relationship between CHI lesion severity and pregnancy loss. Methods: A systematic search of Ovid Embase, Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, Ovid Medline, Google Scholar and CINAHL was carried out. Case reports, cohort, case-control and randomised controlled trials (RCT) detailing the perinatal outcomes of CHI pregnancies, both treated and untreated, were included. Results: No RCTs were identified. However, in a review population of 659 pregnancies, with additional 7 in case reports, CHI treatments included aspirin, prednisone, prednisolone, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), hydroxychloroquine and adalimumab. A descriptive synthesis of data found mixed results for treatments in relation to live birth, miscarriage and fetal growth restriction outcomes. Furthermore, quantitative synthesis of 38 pregnancies revealed a non-significant improvement in live birth rate with CHI targeted treatment (OR 1.79 [95% CI 0.33-9.61] (p=0.50), while meta-analysis of CHI severity in line with pregnancy loss, in a sample of 231 pregnancies, revealed lower odds of pregnancy loss with less severe lesions (OR: 0.17 [0.03-0.80], p=0.03). Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis reinforce notions surrounding the insufficient evidence for CHI treatment. It also strengthens previous hypotheses detailing the positive association between CHI lesion severity and odds of pregnancy loss. Aspirin, LMWH, prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine and adalimumab are candidates with varying levels of weak to moderate evidence supporting their use. Further prospective research is required to obtain robust evidence pertaining to treatment safety and efficacy and optimal drug regimes.

      <td>In Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii), a wide repertoire of resistance genes is often carried within genomic resistance islands (RIs), particularly in high-risk global clones (GCs). As the first in Egypt, the current study aimed at exploring the diversity and genetic configuration of RIs in the clinical isolates of A. baumannii. For this purpose, draft genomes of 18 isolates were generated by Illumina sequencing. Disk diffusion susceptibility profiling revealed multidrug resistance (MDR) and extensive drug resistance (XDR) phenotypes in 27.7 and 72.2%, respectively. The highest susceptibility was noted for tigecycline (100.0%) followed by colistin (94.4%), for which an MIC(50) of 0.25 μg/ml was recorded by the broth microdilution assay. Sequence typing (ST) showed that the majority of the isolates belonged to high-risk global clones (GC1, GC2, and GC9). A novel Oxford sequence type (ST2329) that also formed a novel clonal complex was submitted to the PubMLST database. A novel bla(ADC) variant (bla(ADC−258)) was also identified in strain M18 (ST85(Pas)/1089(Oxf)). In addition to a wide array of resistance determinants, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) disclosed at least nine configurations of genomic RIs distributed over 16/18 isolates. GC2 isolates accumulated the largest number of RIs (three RIs/isolate) followed by those that belong to GC1 (two RIs/isolate). In addition to Tn6022 (44.4%), the comM gene was interrupted by AbaR4 (5.5%) and three variants of A. baumannii genomic resistance island 1(AbGRI)-type RIs (44.4%), including AbaR4b (16.6%) and two novel configurations of AbGRI1-like RIs (22.2%). Three of which (AbaR4, AbaR4b, and AbGRI1-like-2) carried bla(OXA−23) within Tn2006. With less abundance (38.8%), IS26-bound RIs were detected exclusively in GC2 isolates. These included a short version of AbGRI2 (AbGRI2-15) carrying the genes bla(TEM−1) and aphA1 and two variants of AbGRI3 RIs carrying up to seven resistance genes [mphE-msrE-armA-sul1-aadA1-catB8-aacA4]. Confined to GC1 (22.2%), sulfonamide resistance was acquired by an ISAba1 bracketed GIsul2 RI. An additional RI (RI-PER-7) was also identified on a plasmid carried by strain M03. Among others, RI-PER-7 carried the resistance genes armA and bla(PER−7). Here, we provided a closer view of the diversity and genetic organization of RIs carried by a previously unexplored population of A. baumannii.</td>

Colistin resistance mediated by the mcr-1 gene is the most prevalent among animal-derived Escherichia coli, and mcr-1-carrying E. coli have been frequently detected in central-eastern China. However, animal-derived E. coli with AMR and the prevalence of mcr-1 in the Qinghai Plateau have been rarely investigated. Herein, 375 stool samples were collected from 13 poultry farms in Qinghai Province and 346 E. coli strains were isolated, of which eight carried mcr-1. The AMR rates of the E. coli strains to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and tetracycline were all above 90%, and the resistance rates to ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, and florfenicol were above 70%. Multidrug-resistant strains accounted for 95.66% of the total isolates. Twelve E. coli strains showed colistin resistance, from which a total of 46 AMR genes and 36 virulence factors were identified through whole-genome sequencing. The mcr-1 gene resided on the IncHI2, IncI2-type and IncY-type plasmids, and mcr-1 was located in the nikA-nikB-mcr-1-pap2 gene cassette (three strains) or the pap2-mcr-1-ISApl1 structure (one strain). Completed IncI2-type plasmid pMCR4D31–3 sequence (62,259 bp) revealed that it may cause the horizontal transmission of mcr-1 and may increase the risk of its spread through the food chain. Taken together, the AMR of chicken-derived E. coli in the plateau is of concern, suggesting that it is very necessary for us to strengthen the surveillance in various regions under the background of one health.</td>

      <td>Intra-species diversity of Clostridium perfringens: A diverse genetic repertoire reveals its pathogenic potential</td>
      <td>Clostridium perfringens is the causative agent of many enterotoxic diseases in humans and animals, and it is present in diverse environments (soil, food, sewage, and water). Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) have provided a general approach about genetic diversity of C. perfringens; however, those studies are limited to specific locations and often include a reduced number of genomes. In this study, 372 C. perfringens genomes from multiple locations and sources were used to assess the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relatedness of this pathogen. In silico MLST was used for typing the isolates, and the resulting sequence types (ST) were assigned to clonal complexes (CC) based on allelic profiles that differ from its founder by up to double-locus variants. A pangenome analysis was conducted, and a core genome-based phylogenetic tree was created to define phylogenetic groups. Additionally, key virulence factors, toxinotypes, and antibiotic resistance genes were identified using ABRicate against Virulence Factor Database (VFDB), TOXiper, and Resfinder, respectively. The majority of the C. perfringens genomes found in publicly available databases were derived from food (n = 85) and bird (n = 85) isolates. A total of 195 STs, some of them shared between sources such as food and human, horses and dogs, and environment and birds, were grouped in 25 CC and distributed along five phylogenetic groups. Fifty-three percent of the genomes were allocated to toxinotype A, followed by F (32%) and G (7%). The most frequently found virulence factors based on &gt; 70% coverage and 99.95% identity were plc (100%), nanH (99%), ccp (99%), and colA (98%), which encode an alpha-toxin, a sialidase, an alpha-clostripain, and a collagenase, respectively, while tetA (39.5%) and tetB (36.2%), which mediate tetracycline resistance determinants, were the most common antibiotic resistance genes detected. The analyses conducted here showed a better view of the presence of this pathogen across several host species. They also confirm that the genetic diversity of C. perfringens is based on a large number of virulence factors that vary among phylogroups, and antibiotic resistance markers, especially to tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, and macrolides. Those characteristics highlight the importance of C. perfringens as a one of the most common causes of foodborne illness.</td>

      <td>Background: To date, no oral antiviral drug has proven to be beneficial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this randomized, controlled, open-label, platform trial, we randomly assigned patients ≥18 years hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia to receive either camostat mesylate (CM) (considered standard-of-care) or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV). The primary endpoint was time to sustained clinical improvement (≥48 h) of at least one point on the 7-category WHO scale. Secondary endpoints included length of stay (LOS), need for mechanical ventilation (MV) or death, and 29-day mortality. Results: 201 patients were included in the study (101 CM and 100 LPV/RTV) between 20 April 2020 and 14 May 2021. Mean age was 58.7 years, and 67% were male. The median time from symptom onset to randomization was 7 days (IQR 5–9). Patients in the CM group had a significantly shorter time to sustained clinical improvement (HR = 0.67, 95%-CI 0.49–0.90; 9 vs. 11 days, p = 0.008) and demonstrated less progression to MV or death [6/101 (5.9%) vs. 15/100 (15%), p = 0.036] and a shorter LOS (12 vs. 14 days, p = 0.023). A statistically nonsignificant trend toward a lower 29-day mortality in the CM group than the LPV/RTV group [2/101 (2%) vs. 7/100 (7%), p = 0.089] was observed. Conclusion: In patients hospitalized for COVID-19, the use of CM was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement, reduced need for MV or death, and shorter LOS than the use of LPV/RTV. Furthermore, research is needed to confirm the efficacy of CM in larger placebo-controlled trials.

      <td>Global ocean warming results in an increase of infectious diseases including an elevated emergence of Vibrio spp. in Northern Europe. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported annual periods of high to very high risks of infection with Vibrio spp. during summer months along the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts. Based on those facts, the risk of Vibrio infections associated with recreational bathing in European coastal waters increases. To obtain an overview of the seasonal and spatial distribution of potentially human pathogenic Vibrio spp. at German coasts, this study monitored V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus at seven recreational bathing areas from 2017 to 2018, including the heat wave event in summer 2018. The study shows that all three Vibrio species occurred in water and sediment samples at all sampling sites. Temperature was shown to be the main driving factor of Vibrio abundance, whereas Vibrio community composition was mainly modulated by salinity. A species-specific rapid increase was observed at water temperatures above 10°C, reaching the highest detection numbers during the heat wave event with abundances of 4.5 log10 CFU+1/100 ml of seawater and 6.5 log10 CFU+1/100 g of sediment. Due to salinity, the dominant Vibrio species found in North Sea samples was V. parahaemolyticus, whereas V. vulnificus was predominantly detected in Baltic Sea samples. Most detections of V. cholerae were associated with estuarine samples from both seas. Vibrio spp. concentrations in sediments were up to three log higher compared to water samples, indicating that sediments are an important habitat for Vibrio spp. to persist in the environment. Antibiotic resistances were found against beta-lactam antibiotics (ampicillin 31%, cefazolin 36%, and oxacillin and penicillin 100%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (45%). Moreover, isolates harboring pathogenicity-associated genes such as trh for V. parahaemolyticus as well as vcg, cap/wcv, and the 16S rRNA-type B variant for V. vulnificus were detected. All sampled V. cholerae isolates were identified as non-toxigenic non-O1/non-O139 serotypes. To sum up, increasing water temperatures at German North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts provoke elevated Vibrio numbers and encourage human recreational water activities, resulting in increased exposure rates. Owing to a moderate Baltic Sea salinity, the risk of V. vulnificus infections is of particular concern.</td>

The use of whole-genome sequencing for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (WGS-AST) is a powerful alternative to traditional microbiology laboratory methods. Yersinia enterocolitica antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has yet to be described thoroughly in current studies. We assessed and monitored the development of Y. enterocolitica AMR in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region during 2007–2019 based on WGS-AST. Resistance genotypes were predicted based on WGS. Antimicrobial resistance testing using classical microbiology determined resistance to 13 antimicrobial agents in 189 Y. enterocolitica isolates from Ningxia. The highest resistance level was 97.88% for cefazolin, followed by ampicillin (AMP) (44.97%), ciprofloxacin (CIP) (25.40%), streptomycin (STR) (11.11%), and tetracycline (TET) (10.58%). Isolates emerged as chloramphenicol (CHL) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) resistant. The primary plasmid types were IncFII(Y) and ColRNAI. The TET, STR, and SXT resistance were mediated by the tetA, aph(6)-Id, aph(3″)-Ib, and sul2 genes located on the IncQ1 plasmid. The resistant strains were predominantly biotype 4/O:3/ST429 and the hosts were pigs and patients. The number of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains was of concern, at 27.51%. At present, the prediction of antimicrobial resistance based on WGS requires a combination of phenotypes. From 2007 to 2019, Y. enterocolitica isolates from the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region showed a relatively high rate of resistance to cefazolin (CZO) and some resistance to AMP, CIP, STR, and TET. CIP, SXT, and TET showed a relatively clear trend of increasing resistance. Plasmids carrying multiple drug resistance genes are an important mechanism for the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Isolates with low pathogenicity were more likely to present an AMR phenotype than non-pathogenic isolates.</td>

      <td>A multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain of Haemophilus influenzae, Hi-228, with phenotypic resistance toward ampicillin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and azithromycin, was isolated in Oslo, Norway. The strain was part of a clonal outbreak (2016–2017) comprising five ST143 strains with identical resistotypes. Hi-228 carries a novel integrative and conjugative element (ICE), Tn7100, contributing to this remarkable and previously unreported MDR profile. Tn7100 contains the following resistance genes: bla(TEM−1B), catA2, aac(6′)-Im, aph(2″)-Ib, mef (E), and mel. The latter four are previously unreported or rarely reported in H. influenzae. In this study, we investigated the genetic environment, mechanisms of transfer, impact on phenotypic susceptibility, and fitness cost of this ICE. We found that Tn7100 has an overall structure similar to the previously described ICE Tn6686, with bla(TEM−1B) and catA2 carried by Tn3 and Tn10, respectively. The major difference between Tn7100 and Tn6686 is that Tn7100 lacks tet(B) but carries the resistance gene pairs aac(6′)-Im and aph(2″)-Ib and mef (E) and mel. The gene pairs are located on the novel transposable elements Tn7470 and Tn7471, which have high sequence identities to a plasmid in Enterobacterales and an ICE in streptococcal species, respectively. Tn7100 does circularize and is transferable, however, at a low frequency. Head-to-head competition experiments showed that uptake of Tn7100 reduces bacterial fitness. Our study shows that MDR strains are capable of clonal spread and that the H. influenzae supragenome comprises an increasingly wide range of transferable resistance genes, with evidence of transfer from unrelated genera. The findings offer a glimpse into the genome dynamics of H. influenzae, highlighting the importance of rational antibiotic usage to contain antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of MDR strains in this important pathogen.</td>

Traditional Chinese medicine injections (TCMIs) combined with oseltamivir (TCMIs + oseltamivir) are the representative therapeutic strategies for influenza, which is a compliant with clinical applications in China. The aim of this study was to describe the comparative efficacy and safety of TCMIs + oseltamivir in patients with influenza, based on the current evidence. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, VIP information resource integration service platform databases, and the Chinese biomedical literature service system were searched to find randomized controlled trials where TCMIs + oseltamivir are the representative therapeutic strategies for influenza, from inception until October 2021, without language restriction. Two investigators independently screened eligibility criteria, extracted data, and appraised the risk of bias with the same criteria. We conducted a network meta-analysis using the Bayesian random method for each outcome and performed the sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, and Egger’s and Begg’s tests for the reliability and robustness of our results. Results: Thirty-one trials including 2,893 participants proved eligible and reported on four TCMIs + oseltamivir versus oseltamivir. Network meta-analysis showed Yanhuning (YHN) +oseltamivir (MD = −1.7, 95% CrI: −2.5 to −0.88; SUCRA = 0.89; low certainty of evidence) in fever disappearance time, Tanreqing (TRQ) +oseltamivir (MD = −1.9, 95% CrI: −2.8 to −1; SUCRA = 0.97; low certainty of evidence) in cough disappearance time, and Xiyanping (XYP) +oseltamivir (OR = 5.9, 95% CrI: 3.1 to 11; SUCRA = 0.82; very low certainty of evidence) in the response rate to be more efficacious than oseltamivir alone with the best SUCRA. Based on the combined SUCRA value for primary outcomes, TRQ + oseltamivir is probably better in cough disappearance time, and XYP + oseltamivir and YHN + oseltamivir may be better in fever disappearance time than others. No significant difference in safety between the treatments. Conclusion: In patients with influenza, TCMIs + oseltamivir only partially improve flu symptoms. Overall therapeutic efficacy and safety are inconclusive, based on low to very low certainty of evidence. However, the safety remains uncertain, and TCMI treatments for influenza should be considered with caution. More high-quality studies examining the efficacy and safety of TCMIs are needed.

      <td>Type II alveolar epithelial cell aryl hydrocarbon receptor protects against allergic airway inflammation through controlling cell autophagy</td>
      <td>Rationale: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, has been considered as an important regulator for immune diseases. We have previously shown that AhR protects against allergic airway inflammation. The underlying mechanism, however, remains undetermined. Objectives: We sought to determine whether AhR specifically in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AT2) modulates allergic airway inflammation and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: The role of AhR in AT2 cells in airway inflammation was investigated in a mouse model of asthma with AhR conditional knockout mice in AT2 cells (Sftpc-Cre;AhR(f/f)). The effect of AhR on allergen-induced autophagy was examined by both in vivo and in vitro analyses. The involvement of autophagy in airway inflammation was analyzed by using autophagy inhibitor chloroquine. The AhR-regulated gene profiling in AT2 cells was also investigated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Results: Sftpc-Cre;AhR(f/f) mice showed exacerbation of allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation with elevated Th2 cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Notably, an increased allergen-induced autophagy was observed in the lung tissues of Sftpc-Cre;AhR(f/f) mice when compared with wild-type mice. Further analyses suggested a functional axis of AhR-TGF-β1 that is critical in driving allergic airway inflammation through regulating allergen-induced cellular autophagy. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy with autophagy inhibitor chloroquine significantly suppressed cockroach allergen–induced airway inflammation, Th2 cytokines in BALFs, and expression of autophagy-related genes LC3 and Atg5 in the lung tissues. In addition, RNA-seq analysis suggests that autophagy is one of the major pathways and that CALCOCO2/NDP52 and S1009 are major autophagy-associated genes in AT2 cells that may contribute to the AhR-mediated cockroach allergen–induced airway inflammation and, subsequently, allergic asthma. Conclusion: These results suggest that AhR in AT2 cells functions as a protective mechanism against allergic airway inflammation through controlling cell autophagy.</td>

      <td>Objective: Ketamine, an N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, can promote rapid action in the management of individuals with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) at sub-anesthetic doses. However, few studies have investigated the long-term use of ketamine administered intravenously (IV) and intranasally (IN). We report the design and rationale of a therapeutic trial for assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of repeated-dose intramuscular (IM) ketamine vs. active treatment (escitalopram and aripiprazole) in TRD patients. Methods: A comparative, parallel-group, randomized double-blind trial assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of acute (4 weeks) and maintenance (24 weeks) use of IM ketamine (0.75 mg/kg) vs. active control (escitalopram 15 mg and aripiprazole 5 mg) in individuals with moderate-severe intensity TRD (no psychotic symptoms) with or without suicide risk will be conducted. Patients with TRD (18–40 years) will be randomized and blinded to receive ketamine IM or active treatment at a 1:1 ratio for 4 weeks (active treatment) and 24 weeks (maintenance treatment). Subjects will be assessed using clinical scales, monitored for vital signs (VS) after application of injectable medication, and undergo neuropsychological tests. The primary outcome will be changed on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) during the course of the trial. The study is in running. Results: This study can potentially yield evidence on the use of IM ketamine in the treatment of depressive disorders as an ultra-rapid low-cost therapy associated with less patient discomfort and reduced use of medical resources, and can elucidate long-term effects on different outcomes, such as neuropsychological aspects. Conclusions: The trial can help promote the introduction of a novel accessible approach for the treatment of complex disease (TRD) and also allow refinement of its long-term use.

      <td>Almonertinib was approved for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR-TKI-sensitive genetic mutations by National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in 2021.The purpose of this study was to establish and validate a fast, accurate, stable and facile ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantification of almonertinib in rat plasma, it was employed to explore the effect of Paxlovid on the pharmacokinetics of almonertinib in rats. Zanubrutinib was used as an internal standard (IS), and the plasma samples were prepared by the protein precipitation method using acetonitrile. Chromatographic separation was carried out on a Shimadzu LC-20AT ultra-performance liquid chromatography system using a Shim-pack velox C18 (2.1× 50 mm, 2.7 μM) column. The mobile phase consisted of methanol and 0.1% formic acid-water. Mass spectrum analysis was executed using Shimadzu 8040 Triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The precursor and product ions of the analyte and internal standard were detected in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The typical fragment ions were m/z 526.20 → 72.10 for almonertinib and m/z 472.15 → 290.00 for zanubrutinib (IS). The method was validated to have good linearity for quantifying almonertinib in rat plasma from 0.1–1000 ng/ml (R(2) = 0.999), and the LLOQ was 0.1 ng/ml. The validity of this method was sufficiently verified for selectivity, specificity, extraction recovery, matrix effect, accuracy, precision and stability. The validated UHPLC–MS/MS method was successfully applied to the drug interaction study of almonertinib with Paxlovid in rats. Paxlovid significantly inhibits the metabolism of almonertinib and increased the exposure of almonertinib. This study can help us to understand the metabolic profile of almonertinib better, and further human trials should be conducted to validate the results.</td>

Key outcomes included: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scales (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scores and cardiovascular and metabolic parameters. A feasibility assessment evaluated the trials' suitability for inclusion in a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA). Random effects models were used. In total, 1138 records were identified and 19 RCTs contributed to the NMA. Lurasidone doses of 160 mg performed best in terms of change in PANSS and CGI-S scores at 6 weeks, with stronger evidence when compared with brexpiprazole than cariprazine. The safety outcomes were variable; for all treatments, the 95% credible intervals usually contained 'no difference'. Active treatments were associated with lower odds of discontinuation due to any cause, and higher odds of experiencing any adverse event. Lurasidone was comparable to brexpiprazole and cariprazine for efficacy and safety outcomes assessed at 6 weeks, with the 160 mg dose being superior for the change in PANSS and CGI-S outcomes. The lurasidone results were relatively consistent across doses compared with brexpiprazole and cariprazine.</td>

      <td>Introduction Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is an opportunistic infection of immunocompromised hosts with significant morbidity and mortality. The current standard of care, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) at a dose of 15-20 mg/kg/day, is associated with serious adverse drug events (ADE) in 20%-60% of patients. ADEs include hypersensitivity reactions, drug-induced liver injury, cytopenias and renal failure, all of which can be treatment limiting. In a recent meta-analysis of observational studies, reduced dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP was associated with fewer ADEs, without increased mortality. Methods and analysis A phase III randomised, placebo-controlled, trial to directly compare the efficacy and safety of low-dose TMP-SMX (10 mg/kg/day of TMP) with the standard of care (15 mg/kg/day of TMP) among patients with PJP, for a composite primary outcome of change of treatment, new mechanical ventilation, or death. The trial will be undertaken at 16 Canadian hospitals. Data will be analysed as intention to treat. Primary and secondary outcomes will be compared using logistic regression adjusting for stratification and presented with 95% CI. Ethics and dissemination This study has been conditionally approved by the McGill University Health Centre; Ethics approval will be obtained from all participating centres.

      <td>Petasites japonicus extract exerts anti-malarial effects by inhibiting platelet activation</td>
      <td>Background: New antimalarial agents are needed to combat emerging resistance to the currently available drugs. In the pathology of cerebral malaria, platelets play a central role by binding infected and uninfected red cells and the endothelium. Since Petasites japonicus extract was reported as an effective inhibitor of platelet activation, we examined the antimalarial activities of the P. japonicus extract. Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of P. japonicus extract prepared from whole plants on malarial infection. Methods: The P. japonicus extract were characterized by high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) profiling. Antimalarial activity of the P. japonicus ethanolic extract was evaluated in vitro using chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) and chloroquine-resistant (Dd2) P. berghei strains. Also, the in vivo activity of the extract was evaluated in P. berghei-infected mice via oral administration followed by a four-day suppressive test to measure the hematological parameters. In addition, platelet activation signaling induced by the P. japonicus extract in P. berghei infection was evaluated. Results:: In HPLC study, catechin, rutin, liquiritin, 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid were identified in P. japonicus extract. Exposure to the P. japonicus extract significantly inhibited both CQ-sensitive (3D7) and resistant (Dd2) strains of P. falciparum with IC(50) values of 8.48 ± 1.70 and 7.83 ± 6.44 μg/ml, respectively. Administration of the P. japonicus extract also resulted in potent antimalarial activities in P. berghei-infected mice with no associated toxicity. The treatment also improved the hematologic parameters. In addition, the survived mice from P. berghei infection exhibited the inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation by attenuated glycoprotein VI (GPVI) downstream signaling. Conclusion:: P. japonicus extracts promote antimalarial effects both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the effects appear to be induced by the inhibition of collagen-induced platelet activation related to attenuated GPVI downstream signaling. Further studies to identify and characterize the antimalarial compounds in P. japonicus will promote the development of new drugs.</td>

      <td>Signal Detection of Pediatric Drug–Induced Coagulopathy Using Routine Electronic Health Records</td>
      <td>Background: Drug-induced coagulopathy (DIC) is a severe adverse reaction and has become a significantly increased clinical problem in children. It is crucial to the detection of the DIC safety signal for drug post-marketing scientific supervision purposes. Therefore, this study aimed to detect potential signals for DIC in children using the routine electronic medical record (EMR) data. Methods: This study extracted EMR data from Beijing Children’s Hospital between 2009 and 2020. A two-stage modeling method was developed to detect the signal of DIC. We calculated the crude incidence by mining cases of coagulopathy to select the potential suspected drugs; then, propensity score-matched retrospective cohorts of specific screened drugs from the first stage were constructed and estimated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using conditional logistic regression models. The current literature evidence was used to assess the novelty of the signal. Results:In the study, from a total of 340 drugs, 22 drugs were initially screened as potentially inducing coagulopathy. In total, we identified 19 positive DIC associations. Of these, potential DIC risk of omeprazole (OR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.88–2.65), chlorpheniramine (OR:3.04, 95% CI:2.56–3.60), and salbutamol sulfate (OR:1.36, 95% CI:1.07–1.73) were three new DIC signals in both children and adults. Twelve associations between coagulopathy and drugs, meropenem (OR: 3.38, 95% CI: 2.72–4.20), cefoperazone sulbactam (OR: 2.80, 95% CI: 2.30–3.41), fluconazole (OR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.71–2.59), voriconazole (OR: 2.82, 95% CI: 2.20–3.61), ambroxol hydrochloride (OR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.74–2.58), furosemide (OR: 2.36, 95% CI: 2.08–2.67), iodixanol (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.72–2.85), cefamandole (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.56–2.13), ceftizoxime (OR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.44–2.63), ceftriaxone (OR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.44–2.63), latamoxef sodium (OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.49–2.07), and sulfamethoxazole (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01–1.64), were considered as new signals in children. Conclusion: The two-stage algorithm developed in our study to detect safety signals of DIC found nineteen signals of DIC, including twelve new signals in a pediatric population. However, these safety signals of DIC need to be confirmed by further studies based on population study and mechanism research.</td>

      <td>Trichinosis is a serious zoonotic disease that causes human morbidity and mortality. New effective natural remedies with minimal side effects that are well tolerated are needed to treat both enteral and parenteral trichinosis. This study evaluated the efficacy of selenium (Se), Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) and Egyptian propolis compared with albendazole as antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory and anti-Angiogenic agents for treating murine trichinosis. We used parasitological, histopathological and immunohistochemical assays, as well as scanning electron microscopy, to examine adult worms. Overall, 80 Swiss albino male mice were divided into eight groups, with ten mice in each group, as follows: negative control, positive control, albendazole, propolis, Se, combination of propolis and Se, SeNPs and combination of SeNPs and propolis. Mice were slaughtered seven and 35 days after infection to examine the intestinal and muscular phases, respectively. This study demonstrated the efficacy of the combination of SeNPs and propolis. As revealed by electron microscopy, this combination caused damage to the adult worm cuticle. Additionally, compared with albendazole, it resulted in a significant reduction in adult worm and total larval counts; moreover, it caused a decrease in the number of larvae deposited in muscles, with a highly significant decrease in the inflammatory cell infiltrate around the larvae and a considerable decrease in the expression of the angiogenic marker vascular endothelial growth factor in muscles. In conclusion, the combination of SeNPs and propolis had antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory and anti-Angiogenic effects on trichinosis. Consequently, this combination could be used as a natural alternative therapy to albendazole for treating trichinosis.</td>

      <td>Clinically silent corticotroph tumors are usually macroadenomas that comprise 20% of ACTH tumors. They frequently progress to aggressive tumors with high recurrence, invasiveness, and on rare occasions, they may become hormonally active causing Cushing’s disease. Trustable biomarkers that can predict their aggressive course, as well as their response to traditional or new therapies, are paramount. Aberrant β-Catenin expression and localization have been proposed as responsible for several malignancies including pituitary tumors. Nevertheless, the role of β-Catenin in the aggressive transformation of silent corticotropinomas and their response to Temozolomide salvage treatment have not been explored yet. In this work, we present a case of a silent corticotroph tumor that invaded cavernous sinus and compressed optic chiasm and, after a first total resection and tumor remission it recurred six years later as an aggressive ACTH-secreting tumor. This lesion grew with carotid compromise and caused Cushing’s signs. It required multiple medical treatments including Cabergoline, Ketoconazole, TMZ, and radiotherapy. Besides, other two surgeries were needed until it could be controlled. Interestingly, we found α-SMA vascular area reduction and differential β-Catenin cell localization in the more aggressive tumor stages characterized by high Ki-67 indexes and p53 expression. Our results may indicate a role of angiogenesis and β-Catenin trigged events in the pituitary tumor progression, which could in turn affect the response to TMZ and/or conventional treatments. These molecular findings in this unusual case could be useful for future management of aggressive pituitary tumors.</td>

      <td>Background: Previous limited studies have identified that Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) isolates circulating in China possess distinct molecular features and high rates of erythromycin-resistance (ER). Their evolution and potential impact on the prevention and control of global pertussis are worthy of attention. Methods: The present cross-sectional study involved 311 non-duplicate and unrelated B. pertussis strains isolated from Chinese children from 2017 to 2019. Their antimicrobial susceptibilities were assessed using both E-test strips and Kirby-Bauer (KB) disk diffusion methods. Seven virulence-related genes (ptxA, ptxC, ptxP, prn, fim2, fim3, and tcfA2) and the A2047G mutation in the 23S rRNA gene were detected by PCR. Based on the susceptibilities and genotypes, 50 isolates were selected for multi-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) typing and whole-genome sequencing. Results: A total of 311 B. pertussis strains were isolated from children with a median age of 4 months (interquartile range: 2–9 months). Strains carrying the ptxP1 allele were more frequent (84.9%, 264/311), were always ER (except for one strain), and were mainly related to ptxA1/ptxC1/prn1 alleles (99.6%, 263/264). The remaining 47 (15.1%) strains carried the ptxP3 allele, mainly harboring the ptxA1/ptxC2/prn2 alleles (93.6%, 44/47), and were sensitive to erythromycin (except for two strains). The two ER-ptxP3 isolates were first identified in China, belonged to MT27 and MT28 according to MLVA, and were classified into sub-lineage IVd by phylogenetic analysis of their genome sequences. This sub-lineage also includes many strains carrying the ptxP3 allele spreading in developed countries. For each tested antimicrobial, the susceptibilities judged by KB disks were consistent with those determined by E-test strips. Conclusion: The present results reveal that B. pertussis strains with the ptxP1-ER profile still dominate in China, and a few strains carrying the ptxP3 allele have acquired the A2047G mutation in the 23S rRNA gene and the ER phenotype. The surveillance of the drug susceptibility of B. pertussis is necessary for all countries, and the KB disk method can be adopted as a screening test.</td>

      <td>Sciatic–Vagal Nerve Stimulation by Electroacupuncture Alleviates Inflammatory Arthritis in Lyme Disease-Susceptible C3H Mice</td>
      <td>Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, and the pathogenesis of the disease is complex with both bacterial and host factors contributing to inflammatory responses. Lyme disease affects different organs including joints and results in arthritis. Immune responses stimulated by B. burgdorferi through toll-like receptors cause infiltration of leukocytes, which produce inflammatory cytokines and facilitate spirochete clearance. However, arthritic manifestations and chronic fatigue syndrome-like symptoms persist long after completion of antibiotic treatment regimens in a significant number of patients. To counter the effects of inflammation, treatment by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hydroxychloroquine, or synovectomy to eradicate inflammatory arthritis in the involved joint could be employed; however, they often have long-term consequences. Acupuncture has been used for a long time in Asian medicine to diminish pain during various ailments, but the effects and its mechanism are just beginning to be explored. Control of inflammation by neuronal stimulation has been exploited as a systemic therapeutic intervention to arrest inflammatory processes. Our objective was to determine whether activation of the sciatic–vagal network by electroacupuncture on ST36 acupoint, which is used to control systemic inflammation in experimental models of infectious disorders such as endotoxemia, can also alleviate Lyme arthritis symptoms in mice. This aim was further strengthened by the reports that sciatic–vagal neuronal network stimulation can lead to dopamine production in the adrenal medulla and moderate the production of inflammatory factors. We first assessed whether electroacupuncture affects spirochete colonization to attenuate Lyme arthritis. Interestingly, bioluminescent B. burgdorferi burden detected by live imaging and qPCR were similar in electroacupuncture- and mock-treated mice, while electroacupuncture induced a lasting anti-inflammatory effect on mice. Despite the discontinuation of treatment at 2 weeks, the simultaneous decrease in neutrophils in the joints and inflammatory cytokine levels throughout the body at 4 weeks suggests a systemic and persistent effect of electroacupuncture that attenuates Lyme arthritis. Our results suggest that electroacupuncture-mediated anti-inflammatory responses could offer promising healthcare benefits in patients suffering from long-term Lyme disease manifestations.</td>

      <td>Description of Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus aureus Clonal Complex 30 Related to the Pandemic Phage Type 80/81 Isolated from Patients in Three Tertiary Hospitals in Jos, North Central Nigeria</td>
      <td>Objective: The prevalence of phage 80/81 Staphylococcus aureus strains, the pandemic strains that were dominant in the 1950s, had declined in the 1960s and 1970s. However, these strains have reemerged in some countries in recent years. This study investigated the antibacterial resistance, virulence, and the genetic backgrounds of CC30-MSSA isolates obtained from patients in three tertiary hospitals. Materials and Methods: Twenty-Two CC30-MSSA isolates cultured from different clinical samples were investigated using antibiotic sensitivity testing, spa typing, multilocus sequence typing, and DNA microarray analysis. Results: All 22 isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (MIC ≤2 μg/mL), teicoplanin (MIC ≤2 μg/mL), and cefoxitin but were resistant to penicillin G (n = 22; 100.0%), tetracycline (n = 12; 54.5%), ciprofloxacin (n = 15; 68.2%), cadmium acetate (n = 22; 100%), mercuric chloride (n = 13; 59.1%), and ethidium bromide (n = 3; 13.6%). The isolates belonged to sequence type, ST30, and five spa types: T012 (n = 12; 54.5%), t019 (n = 5; 22.7%), t017 (n = 2; 9.1%), t037 (n = 2; 9.1%), and t318 (n = 1; 4.5%). All 22 isolates were positive for agrIII, cap8, clfA, clfB, icaA, icaC, icaD, cna, and staphylococcal enterotoxin gene clusters (seg, sei, sem, sen, seo, seu). Eight isolates carried lukS-PV and lukF-PV that code for Panton-Valentine leukocidin. Conclusion: The current CC30-MSSA isolates share phenotypic and genotypic characteristics with the pandemic phage 80/81 isolates that were common in the 1950s and 1960s. Continued surveillance is recommended to keep abreast of the changing epidemiology of S. aureus causing healthcare and community-Associated infections.</td>

      <td>Gender Differences in the Psychopharmacological Treatment of Forensic In-Patients With Schizophrenia</td>
      <td>Background: In forensic psychiatry, psychopharmacological treatment plays a crucial role for patients with schizophrenia in improving their medical as well as legal prognosis. However, an increase in the number of females entering forensic treatment has yet to yield empirical research on the outcome of psychopharmacological treatment of female patients with schizophrenia in terms of efficacy and tolerability. Aims: The aim of the present study is to elucidate pharmacological treatment strategies of women with schizophrenia in forensic psychiatry in comparison with men. Methods: This study compares psychopharmacological treatment strategies, psychopathological features, as well as neurological and metabolic side effects of treatment between 29 female and 29 male in-patients with schizophrenia in three forensic facilities in Bavaria, Germany. Results: Results show significant differences between genders. Poorer psychopathological and neurological features were found in the female sample, while men registered worse metabolic parameters. In terms of psychopharmacological treatment strategies, female in-patients were more often prescribed second-generation depot antipsychotics. Surprisingly, the potency of the dosages did not differ between genders. The results suggest that female forensic patients with schizophrenia have more severe and refractory diseases than their male counterparts. Conclusion: Recommendations for gender-specific treatment strategies are derived.</td>

      <td>Selected Methods of Therapeutic Interactions With People With Mild Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder</td>
      <td>In this review we present the behavioral aspects of interaction in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), taking into account some aspects of pharmacotherapy. In the treatment of people with ASD, an individual approach to emotional, social and cognitive functioning is very important. The specificity of symptoms and their severity in people with ASD results from deficits/disfunction of various areas of the brain and is associated with different levels of intelligence. This manuscript considers selected methods of interaction with ASD patients with normal IQ. Due to the different ways of functioning, these people often find it difficult to adapt to social expectations. The most important thing is to understand their perception of themselves and the world around them in order to support them in coping with the daily challenges. Due to the increasing problem, more and more attention is being focused on early detection of ASD, what allows to intervene as fast as possible and in consequence affect the quality of life of people with this dysfunctions. However, participants with mild autism symptoms are still difficult to diagnose in the practice. The effectiveness of the therapy depends largely on the cooperation of educational institutions. It is also necessary to contact specialist clinics, including a mental health counseling center. However, in the case of children and adolescents, the cooperation between the therapist and their parents is the basis. Systemic family therapy is also important in adults with ASD. An overview of the methods of therapeutic interactions in ASD, what may be helpful in diagnosing of mild ASD, were presented in our manuscript.</td>

      <td>Metabolic reprogramming is an emerging hallmark of tumor cells. In order to survive in the nutrient-deprived environment, tumor cells rewire their metabolic phenotype to provide sufficient energy and build biomass to sustain their transformed state and promote malignant behaviors. Amino acids are the main compositions of protein, which provide key intermediate substrates for the activation of signaling pathways. Considering that cells can synthesize arginine via argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1), arginine is regarded as a non-essential amino acid, making arginine depletion as a promising therapeutic strategy for ASS1-silencing tumors. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of expression pattern of ASS1 and related signaling pathways in cancer and its potential role as a novel therapeutic target in cancer. Besides, we outline how ASS1 affects metabolic regulation and tumor progression and further discuss the role of ASS1 in arginine deprivation therapy. Finally, we review approaches to target ASS1 for cancer therapies.</td>

      <td>Pharmacological characterisation of electrocardiogram J-T(peak) interval in conscious Guinea pigs</td>
      <td>Drug-induced human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel block and QT interval prolongation increase torsade de pointes (TdP) risk. However, some drugs block hERG channels and prolong QT interval with low TdP risk, likely because they block additional inward currents. We investigated the utility of J-T(peak) interval, a novel biomarker of inward current block and TdP risk, in conscious telemetered guinea pigs. Electrocardiogram parameters were analysed in Hartley guinea pigs orally administered one of eight test compounds (dofetilide, flecainide, nifedipine, quinidine, quinine, ranolazine, sotalol, verapamil) or vehicle alone as controls. Heart rate-corrected QT (QTcX) and J-T(peak) (J-T(peak)cX) were calculated to evaluate the relations of QT–RR and J-T(peak)–RR. Dofetilide and sotalol significantly increased ΔQTcX and ΔJ-T(peak)cX intervals to similar degrees. Quinidine, quinine and flecainide also increased ΔQTcX and ΔJ-T(peak)cX intervals, but the degrees of ΔJ-T(peak)cX interval prolongation were shorter than those of ΔQTcX interval prolongation. Ranolazine showed slight increasing trends in ΔQTcX and ΔJ-T(peak)cX intervals, but the differences were not significant. Verapamil and nifedipine did not increase the ΔQTcX or ΔJ-T(peak)cX intervals. Based on the relations of ΔΔJ-T(peak)cX and ΔΔQTcX intervals, dofetilide, sotalol and quinidine were classified as high risk for TdP, quinine, flecainide and ranolazine were classified as intermediate risk and verapamil and nifedipine were classified as low risk. These results supported the usefulness of J-T(peak) interval assessment in conscious guinea pigs for predicting drug-induced balanced block of inward currents and TdP risk in early-stage preclinical studies.</td>

      <td>High-Titer Production of the Fungal Anhydrotetracycline, TAN-1612, in Engineered Yeasts</td>
      <td>Antibiotic resistance is a growing global health threat, demanding urgent responses. Tetracyclines, a widely used antibiotic class, are increasingly succumbing to antibiotic resistance; generating novel analogues is therefore a top priority for public health. Fungal tetracyclines provide structural and enzymatic diversity for novel tetracycline analogue production in tractable heterologous hosts, like yeasts, to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Here, we successfully engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) and Saccharomyces boulardii (probiotic yeast) to produce the nonantibiotic fungal anhydrotetracycline, TAN-1612, in synthetic defined media-necessary for clean purifications-through heterologously expressing TAN-1612 genes mined from the fungus, Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015. This was accomplished via (i) a promoter library-based combinatorial pathway optimization of the biosynthetic TAN-1612 genes coexpressed with a putative TAN-1612 efflux pump, reducing TAN-1612 toxicity in yeasts while simultaneously increasing supernatant titers and (ii) the development of a medium-throughput UV-visible spectrophotometric assay that facilitates TAN-1612 combinatorial library screening. Through this multipronged approach, we optimized TAN-1612 production, yielding an over 450-fold increase compared to previously reported S. cerevisiae yields. TAN-1612 is an important tetracycline analogue precursor, and we thus present the first step toward generating novel tetracycline analogue therapeutics to combat current and emerging antibiotic resistance. We also report the first heterologous production of a fungal polyketide, like TAN-1612, in the probiotic S. boulardii. This highlights that engineered S. boulardii can biosynthesize complex natural products like tetracyclines, setting the stage to equip probiotic yeasts with synthetic therapeutic functionalities to generate living therapeutics or biocontrol agents for clinical and agricultural applications.</td>

      <td>Currently, various potential therapeutic agents for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are being investigated worldwide mainly through the drug repurposing approach. Several anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-malarial, and anti-inflammatory drugs were employed in randomized trials and observational studies for developing new therapeutics for COVID-19. Although an increasing number of repurposed drugs have shown anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in vitro, so far only remdesivir has been approved by the US FDA to treat COVID-19, and several other drugs approved for Emergency Use Authorization, including sotrovimab, tocilizumab, baricitinib, paxlovid, molnupiravir, and other potential strategies to develop safe and effective therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection are still underway. Many drugs employed as anti-viral may exert unwanted side effects (i.e., toxicity) via unknown mechanisms. To quickly assess these drugs for their potential toxicological effects and mechanisms, we used the Tox21 in vitro assay datasets generated from screening ∼10,000 compounds consisting of approved drugs and environmental chemicals against multiple cellular targets and pathways. Here we summarize the toxicological profiles of small molecule drugs that are currently under clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 based on their in vitro activities against various targets and cellular signaling pathways.</td>

      <td>Zebrafish Modeling of Autism Spectrum Disorders, Current Status and Future Prospective</td>
      <td>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a complicated range of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders which can occur via genetic or non-genetic factors. Clinically, ASD is associated with problems in relationships, social interactions, and behaviors that pose many challenges for children with ASD and their families. Due to the complexity, heterogeneity, and association of symptoms with some neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD, anxiety, and sleep disorders, clinical trials have not yielded reliable results and there still remain challenges in drug discovery and development pipeline for ASD patients. One of the main steps in promoting lead compounds to the suitable drug for commercialization is preclinical animal testing, in which the efficacy and toxicity of candidate drugs are examined in vivo. In recent years, zebrafish have been able to attract the attention of many researchers in the field of neurological disorders such as ASD due to their outstanding features. The presence of orthologous genes for ASD modeling, the anatomical similarities of parts of the brain, and similar neurotransmitter systems between zebrafish and humans are some of the main reasons why scientists draw attention to zebrafish as a prominent animal model in preclinical studies to discover highly effective treatment approaches for the ASD through genetic and non-genetic modeling methods.</td>

      <td>Vitexin alters Staphylococcus aureus surface hydrophobicity to obstruct biofilm formation</td>
      <td>Cell Surface hydrophobicity is one of the determinant biophysical parameters of bacterial aggregation for being networked to form a biofilm. Phytoconstituent, like vitexin, has long been in use for their antibacterial effect. The present work demonstrates the role of vitexin in modulating Staphylococcus aureus surface hydrophobicity while aggregating to form biofilm and pathogenesis in a host. In planktonic form, vitexin shows minimum inhibitory concentration at 252 µg/ml against S. aureus. Sub-MIC doses of vitexin and antibiotics (26 µg/ml of vitexin, 55 µg/ml of azithromycin, and 2.5 µg/ml of gentamicin) were selected to treat S. aureus. Dead cell counts after treatment were studied through flow cytometry. As dead cell counts were minimal (&lt;5 %), these doses were considered for all subsequent experiments. While studying aggregating cells, it was observed that vitexin reduces S. aureus surface hydrophobicity and membrane permeability at the sub-MIC dose of 26 µg/ml. The in silico binding analysis showed a higher binding affinity of vitexin with surface proteins (IcaA, DltA, and SasG) of S. aureus. Down-regulation of dltA and icaAB expression, along with the reduction in membrane potential with a sub-MIC dose of vitexin, explains reduced S. aureus surface hydrophobicity. Vitexin was found to interfere with S. aureus biofilm-associated protein biomass, EPS production, and swarming movement. Subsequently, the suppression of proteases production and down-regulation of icaAB and agrAC gene expression with a sub-MIC dose of vitexin explained the inhibition of S. aureus virulence in vitro. Besides, vitexin was also found to potentiate the antibiofilm activity of sub-MIC doses of gentamicin and azithromycin. Treatment with vitexin exhibits a protective response in S. aureus infected macrophages through modulation of expression of cytokines like IL-10 and IL-12p40 at protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, CFU count and histological examination of infected mouse tissue (liver and spleen) justify the in vivo protective effect of vitexin from S. aureus biofilm-associated infection. From this study, it can be inferred that vitexin can reduce S. aureus surface hydrophobicity, leading to interference with aggregation at the time of biofilm formation and subsequent pathogenesis in a host.</td>

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are an established model for studying developmental processes, but they resemble epiblast and are sub-optimal for modeling EGA. DUX4 regulates human EGA by inducing cleavage-stage-specific genes, while it also induces cell death. We report here that a short-pulsed expression of DUX4 in primed hESCs activates an EGA-like gene expression program in up to 17% of the cells, retaining cell viability. These DUX4-induced cells resembled eight-cell stage blastomeres and were named induced blastomere-like (iBM) cells. The iBM cells showed marked reduction of POU5F1 protein, as previously observed in mouse two-cell-like cells. Finally, the iBM cells were successfully enriched using an antibody against NaPi2b (SLC34A2), which is expressed in human blastomeres. The iBM cells provide an improved model system to study human EGA transcriptome.</td>

      <td>Interventions for managing medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw</td>
      <td>Background: Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a severe adverse reaction experienced by some individuals to certain medicines commonly used in the treatment of cancer and osteoporosis (e.g. bisphosphonates, denosumab, and antiangiogenic agents), and involves the progressive destruction of bone in the mandible or maxilla. Depending on the drug, its dosage, and the duration of exposure, this adverse drug reaction may occur rarely (e.g. following the oral administration of bisphosphonate or denosumab treatments for osteoporosis, or antiangiogenic agent-targeted cancer treatment), or commonly (e.g. following intravenous bisphosphonate for cancer treatment). MRONJ is associated with significant morbidity, adversely affects quality of life (QoL), and is challenging to treat. This is an update of our review first published in 2017. Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the prophylaxis of MRONJ in people exposed to antiresorptive or antiangiogenic drugs. To assess the effects of non-surgical or surgical interventions (either singly or in combination) versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the treatment of people with manifest MRONJ. Search methods: Cochrane Oral Health’s Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 16 June 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one modality of intervention with another for the prevention or treatment of MRONJ. For 'prophylaxis of MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was the incidence of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, time-to-event, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention. For 'treatment of established MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was healing of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, recurrence, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported the risk ratio (RR) (or rate ratio) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Main results: We included 13 RCTs (1668 participants) in this updated review, of which eight were new additions. The studies were clinically diverse and examined very different interventions, so meta-analyses could not be performed. We have low or very low certainty about available evidence on interventions for the prophylaxis or treatment of MRONJ. Prophylaxis of MRONJ. Five RCTs examined different interventions to prevent the occurrence of MRONJ. One RCT compared standard care with regular dental examinations at three-month intervals and preventive treatments (including antibiotics before dental extractions and the use of techniques for wound closure that avoid exposure and contamination of bone) in men with metastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid. The intervention seemed to lower the risk of MRONJ (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.39, 253 participants). Secondary outcomes were not evaluated. Dentoalveolar surgery is considered a common predisposing event for developing MRONJ and five RCTs tested various preventive measures to reduce the risk of postoperative MRONJ. The studies evaluated plasma rich in growth factors inserted into the postextraction alveolus in addition to standardised medical and surgical care versus standardised medical and surgical care alone (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.51, 176 participants); delicate surgery and closure by primary intention versus non-traumatic tooth avulsion and closure by secondary intention (no case of postoperative MRONJ in either group); primary closure of the extraction socket with a mucoperiosteal flap versus application of platelet-rich fibrin without primary wound closure (no case of postoperative MRONJ in either group); and subperiosteal wound closure versus epiperiosteal wound closure (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.56, 132 participants). Treatment of MRONJ. Eight RCTs examined different interventions for the treatment of established MRONJ; that is, the effect on MRONJ cure rates. One RCT analysed hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment used in addition to standard care (antiseptic rinses, antibiotics, and surgery) compared with standard care alone (at last follow-up: RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.18, 46 participants). Healing rates from MRONJ were not significantly different between autofluorescence-guided bone surgery and conventional bone surgery (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37, 30 participants). Another RCT that compared autofluorescence- with tetracycline fluorescence-guided sequestrectomy for the surgical treatment of MRONJ found no significant difference (at one-year follow-up: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30, 34 participants). Three RCTs investigated the effect of growth factors and autologous platelet concentrates on healing rates of MRONJ: platelet-rich fibrin after bone surgery versus surgery alone (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22, 47 participants), bone morphogenetic protein-2 together with platelet-rich fibrin versus platelet-rich fibrin alone (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.29, 55 participants), and concentrated growth factor and primary wound closure versus primary wound closure only (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.34, 28 participants). Two RCTs focused on pharmacological treatment with teriparatide: teriparatide 20 μg daily versus placebo in addition to standard care (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.95, 33 participants) and teriparatide 56.5 μg weekly versus teriparatide 20 μg daily in addition to standard care (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.44, 12 participants). Authors' conclusions: Prophylaxis of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw. One open-label RCT provided some evidence that dental examinations at three-month intervals and preventive treatments may be more effective than standard care for reducing the incidence of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) in individuals taking intravenous bisphosphonates for advanced cancer. We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be very low. There is insufficient evidence to either claim or refute a benefit of the interventions tested for prophylaxis of MRONJ in patients with antiresorptive therapy undergoing dentoalveolar surgery. Although some interventions suggested a potential large effect, the studies were underpowered to show statistical significance, and replication of the results in larger studies is pending. Treatment of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw. The available evidence is insufficient to either claim or refute a benefit, in addition to standard care, of any of the interventions studied for the treatment of MRONJ.</td>

      <td>Introduction and hypothesis: To study the mid-term safety and functional outcomes of transvaginal anterior vaginal wall prolapse repair using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mesh (DynaMesh®-PR4) by the double trans-obturator technique (TOT). Methods: Between 2015 and 2020, we prospectively included women with symptomatic high-stage anterior vaginal wall prolapse with or without uterine prolapse or stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in the study. The patients underwent transvaginal repair of the prolapse using PVDF mesh in two medical centers. We followed all patients for at least 12 months. We recorded the characteristics of vaginal and sexual symptoms, urinary incontinence, and prolapse stage pre- and postoperatively using International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Vaginal Symptoms (ICIQ-VS), International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF), and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system, respectively. Results: One hundred eight women were included in the final analysis with a mean follow-up time of 34.5 ± 18.6 months. The anatomical success was achieved in 103 (95.4%) patients. There was a significant improvement in patients’ vaginal symptoms, urinary incontinence, and quality of life scores postoperatively (p &lt; 0.0001). Only six patients (5.5%) had mesh extrusion, five of whom were managed successfully. The total rates of complications and de novo urinary symptoms were 21.3% and 7.4%, respectively. Significant pain was reported in 17 cases (15.7%). Conclusion: Our findings show that using PVDF mesh in the double TOT technique for anterior vaginal wall prolapse repair is a safe procedure with high anatomic and functional success rates and acceptable complication rates in mid-term follow-up.</td>

      <td>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic degenerative joint disease with few treatment options. The pathogenesis of OA is characterized by sustained inflammation, oxidative stress and chondrocyte apoptosis that eventually lead to cartilage degradation and joint dysfunction. In the present study, we identified a synthetic triterpenoid CDDO-Im(1-[2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)–dien-28-oyl] imidazole) as an activator of Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) that displayed strong anti-OA effects. We showed that CDDO-Im (20 nM) significantly alleviated TNF-α-induced apoptosis of primary human chondrocytes and extracellular matrix degradation. In a mouse OA model incurred by DMM (destabilization of medial meniscus), administration of CDDO-Im (2.5 mg/kg, ip, every other day for 8 weeks) effectively reduced knee joint cartilage erosion and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6. We revealed that CDDO-Im (20 nM) significantly enhanced autophagy activities in chondrocytes, whereas the autophagy inhibition by chloroquine (CQ, 50 μM) or 3-methyladenine (3-MA, 5 mM) abrogated the anti-apoptosis and chondroprotective effects of CDDO-Im in TNF-α-treated chondrocytes. Moreover, we confirmed that CDDO-Im (1–20 nM) dose-dependently activated Nrf2 pathway in TNF-α-treated chondrocytes, and its chondroprotective and autophagy-enhancing effects were significantly diminished when Nrf2 signaling was blocked by Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 (20 μM) or siRNA-mediated Nrf2 knockdown. Together, our results demonstrate that CDDO-Im exhibits prominent chondroprotective and anti-OA activities owing to its Nrf2 activation and autophagy-enhancing properties, which might provide new insights into the strategies of OA clinical prevention and treatment.</td>

      <td>Duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment for acute exacerbations of cystic fibrosis: A systematic review: Duration of treatment for acute exacerbations of cystic fibrosis</td>
      <td>Background: Acute exacerbations of Cystic Fibrosis (AECF) are associated with significant morbidity. Recommendations are to treat for 2-3 weeks despite limited data. Spirometry is a measure of clinical response yet appears to plateau at 7-10 days. While durations &lt;9 days have been associated with poorer outcomes, a duration of 10 days may be as effective as 14 days, potentially conferring advantages in terms of cost and adverse events. A 2019 Cochrane review by Abbott et al. did not identify any randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing durations of treatment. Utilising data from non-randomised studies (NRS), we report a systematic review of intravenous antibiotic treatment, exploring changes in FEV(1) (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second), CRP (C-reactive protein) and peripheral WBC (white blood cell) count in studies with different treatment durations. Study design and methods: Systematic review of published literature following a search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Clinical Trials register. Guidelines from the Preferred Reporting items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and reporting Meta-analysis of Observational studies (MOOSE) statement were followed. Results: No randomised controlled trials were identified that specifically examined duration of treatment during AECF. This study included all relevant RCTs and also NRS, grouping according to study characteristics, such as length of treatment, location, year, and also characteristics of the patient population. 52 studies, comprising 79 subgroups, and 1,597 patients, were identified. Mean change (95%CI) in ppFEV(1) was 10.13 (9.21-11.05). There was no significant difference in change in ppFEV(1) for studies treating for 10-12 days; 8.85 (7.47-10.23), vs 13-15 days; 10.68 (9.53-11.82). Similar changes in CRP and WBC were seen irrespective of treatment duration. Conclusion: This systematic review provides evidence that shorter durations of treatment may be associated with similar changes in FEV(1), CRP and WBC compared with longer durations.</td>

Animals: Two year old male neutered mix-breed dog. Methods: The dog presented for a grade IIIa open highly comminuted fracture of the shaft and tuber of the left calcaneus from a suspected gunshot wound. Plantar and lateral locking plates were applied to the calcaneus, with the lateral plate extending proximally and sutured directly to the common calcaneal tendon. Autogenous cancellous and allogenic corticocancellous bone grafts were placed into the fracture site, and a human placental matrix was injected after closure. A lateral tarsal splint was applied for 17 weeks postoperatively. The lateral bone-to-tendon plate was replaced with a smaller lateral plate spanning only the calcaneus 9 weeks after the initial surgery. Results: Radiographic union was documented at 17 weeks. At 25 weeks, both plates were removed due to suspected implant associated infection. At the final follow-up assessment, 36 weeks after initial surgery, the dog had returned to normal function with no observable lameness. Conclusion: Incorporation of the common calcaneal tendon as a proximal segment for plate fixation led to successful union of a highly comminuted calcaneal fracture.</td>

      <td>Mechanism of anti-inflammatory effects of rifampicin in an ex vivo culture system of hidradenitis suppurativa</td>
      <td>Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of the hair follicles leading to painful lesions, associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Numerous guidelines recommend antibiotics like clindamycin and rifampicin in combination, as first-line systemic therapy in moderate-to-severe forms of inflammation. HS has been proposed to be mainly an auto-inflammatory disease associated with but not initially provoked by bacteria. Therefore, it has to be assumed that the pro-inflammatory milieu previously observed in HS skin is not solely dampened by the bacteriostatic inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. To further clarify the mechanism of anti-inflammatory effects of rifampicin, ex vivo explants of lesional HS from 8 HS patients were treated with rifampicin, and its effect on cytokine production, immune cells as well as the expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) were investigated. Analysis of cell culture medium of rifampicin-treated HS explants revealed an anti-inflammatory effect of rifampicin that significantly inhibiting interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α production. Immunohistochemistry of the rifampicin-treated explants suggested a tendency for it to reduce the expression of TLR2 while not affecting the number of immune cells.</td>

      <td>The negative impact of vitamin D on antipsychotic drug exposure may counteract its potential benefits in schizophrenia</td>
      <td>Aims: Patients with schizophrenia frequently show insufficient vitamin D levels, which are associated with somatic comorbidity and may contribute to psychopathology. For many reasons, vitamin D supplementation may be indicated for this patient cohort. However, there is growing evidence for a vitamin D-mediated increase of drug metabolism by induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Hence, this study aimed to assess vitamin D's impact on both antipsychotic drug concentrations and psychopathology in a non-interventional manner. Methods: Totals of 107 serum concentrations of different antipsychotic drugs (amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone), 80 serum concentrations of vitamin D and psychopathological assessments were obtained from 80 patients with schizophrenia. The impact of Vitamin D on antipsychotic drug concentrations and symptomatology was assessed using a generalized linear model, path and correlation analyses. Results: We observed a negative relationship between vitamin D and dose-adjusted antipsychotic drug concentrations, which was particularly pronounced for drugs which are predominantly metabolized via CYP3A4 (i.e., aripiprazole and quetiapine). A path analysis suggested a relieving effect of vitamin D on symptomatology which was, however, counteracted by its negative impact on antipsychotic drug levels. Finally, patients with vitamin D levels above the median exhibited a significantly higher proportion of therapeutically insufficient dose-normalized drug concentrations of aripiprazole and quetiapine. Conclusion: Despite vitamin D's potential benefits on physical and mental health, clinicians should be aware of its negative impact on blood concentrations of antipsychotics metabolized by CYP3A4 in patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, when considering its supplementation, therapeutic drug monitoring should be applied to guide dose adjustment.</td>

      <td>Investigations into the stability of 17 psychoactive drugs in a “simulated postmortem blood” model</td>
      <td>In the postmortem environment, some drugs and metabolites may degrade due to microbial activity, even forming degradation products that are not produced in humans. Consequently, underestimation or overestimation of perimortem drug concentrations or even false negatives are possible when analyzing postmortem specimens. Therefore, understanding whether medications may be susceptible to microbial degradation is critical in order to ensure that reliable detection and quantitation of drugs and their degradation products is achieved in toxicology screening methods. In this study, a “simulated postmortem blood” model constructed of antemortem human whole blood inoculated with a broad population of human fecal microorganisms was used to investigate the stability of 17 antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs. Microbial communities present in the experiments were determined to be relevant to postmortem blood microorganisms by 16S rRNA sequencing analyses. After 7 days of exposure to the community at 37°C, drug stability was evaluated using liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection (LC-DAD) and with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). Most of the investigated drugs were found to be stable in inoculated samples and noninoculated controls. However, the 1,2-benzisothiazole antipsychotics, ziprasidone and lurasidone, were found to degrade at a rate comparable with the known labile control, risperidone. In longer experiments (7 to 12 months), where specimens were stored at −20°C, 4°C, and ambient temperature, N-dealkylation degradation products were detected for many of the drugs, with greater formation in specimens stored at −20°C than at 4°C.</td>

      <td>Background: Extensive and inappropriate use of quinolones has led to growing resistance rates to these broad-spectrum antibiotics. The present study purposed to investigate the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates. Method: Ninety-two non-repetitive K. pneumoniae clinical isolates were confirmed by standard microbiological methods. Antibacterial susceptibility of isolates toward seven agents from the quinolone family was evaluated by the disc diffusion method. Ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the standard agar dilution method. PCR amplification was used to detect the existence of PMQR genes in the studied isolates. Results: In the present study, significant quinolones' resistance (40%) was observed in K. pneumoniae isolates, and most of the strains were resistant to nalidixic acid (94.6%) and ofloxacin (45.6%). MIC analysis showed 15 strains were resistant to 6–128 μg/ml of ciprofloxacin, and five were intermediately-resistant. PMQR genes were detected in 88% of all isolates. Acc(6’)-Ib-cr was constituted half of the total PMQR genes detected among ciprofloxacin non-susceptible isolates. Of 20 ciprofloxacin non-susceptible isolates, 65% (n = 13) harbored multiple PMQR determinants, and 15 strains were determined as integron carriage. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicated considerable resistance against quinolones, which could be correlated with the extensive and inappropriate use of this class of antibiotics as empirical treatment.</td>

      <td>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has a high mortality rate and transmissibility. In this context, medicinal plants have attracted attention due to the wide availability and variety of therapeutic compounds, such as alkaloids, a vast class with several proven pharmacological effects, like the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, this scoping review aimed to summarize the current knowledge of the potential applicability of alkaloids for treating COVID-19. A systematic search was performed on PubMed and Scopus, from database inception to August 2021. Among the 63 eligible studies, 65.07% were in silico model, 20.63% in vitro and 14.28% clinical trials and observational studies. According to the in silico assessments, the alkaloids 10-hydroxyusambarensine, cryptospirolepine, crambescidin 826, deoxynortryptoquivaline, ergotamine, michellamine B, nigellidine, norboldine and quinadoline B showed higher binding energy with more than two target proteins. The remaining studies showed potential use of berberine, cephaeline, emetine, homoharringtonine, lycorine, narciclasine, quinine, papaverine and colchicine. The possible ability of alkaloids to inhibit protein targets and to reduce inflammatory markers show the potential for development of new treatment strategies against COVID-19. However, more high quality analyses/reviews in this field are necessary to firmly establish the effectiveness/safety of the alkaloids here described.</td>

      <td>Objective: To describe repair of perineal hernias in dogs positioned in dorsal recumbency. Study design: Retrospective case series. Sample population: Twenty-three dogs with perineal hernias treated by herniorrhaphy, with or without adjunctive procedures. Methods: Medical records from 2016 to 2020 were reviewed for technique description and animal outcomes, and owners and referring veterinarians were contacted for follow-up information. Results: Internal obturator muscle transposition (IOMT) was performed in 22 dogs, and polypropylene mesh repair was performed in one dog. Transection of the internal obturator tendon was feasible in all dogs undergoing IOMT. Eighteen dogs underwent abdominal pexy procedures, castration, or both during the same anesthetic period. No intraoperative complications were noted. Postoperative complications were noted in the hospital in 14 dogs and after release in 11. Incisional infection/drainage and persistent urinary incontinence were reported in four and two dogs, respectively. Hernias reoccurred in four dogs and tended to be more common in dogs that had undergone previous herniorrhaphies (p =.053). Recurrence rates were lowest in dogs that had no prior hernia repair or organ pexy (p =.035). Conclusion: Perineal hernia repair was feasible in dorsal recumbency. Complication and recurrence rates of perineal herniorrhaphy in dorsal recumbency were similar to those reported for dogs undergoing the procedure in sternal recumbency. Clinical significance: Positioning of patients for perineal hernia repair can be dictated by surgeon preference. Perineal hernia repair in dorsal recumbency allows a single-stage abdominal and perineal approach without repositioning.</td>

This study aimed to investigate the effects of NAs on HBsAg reduction and association with serum IFN-λ3 levels in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Methods: A total of 91 patients [51 treated with nucleoside analog entecavir hydrate (ETV) and 40 treated with nucleotide analog adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)] with clinically evident CHB (chronic hepatitis, 57; liver cirrhosis, 34) were enrolled in this study. Serum IFN-λ3 levels among patients receiving ETV and ADV/TDF were measured before the initiation of therapy and 1, 3, and 5 years post-therapy. Results: The change (mean ± standard deviation) in serum HBsAg levels from baseline to year five was −0.38 ± 0.46 and −0.84 ± 0.64 log(10) IU/ml in ETV and ADV/TDF groups, respectively (p = 0.0004). Higher serum IFN-λ3 levels were observed in ADV/TDF group compared with ETV group during treatment (p &lt; 0.001). Serum IFN-λ3 levels showed negative correlation with HBsAg reduction in ADV/TDF group (r = −0.386, p = 0.038) at week 48. Nucleotide analogs (ADV/TDF) treatment has associated factors with −0.3 log HBsAg decline at 1 year, −0.5 log HBsAg decline at 3 years, and −0.8 log HBsAg decline at 5 years after NAs treatment on multivariate analysis.

      <td>Continuous Dopaminergic Stimulation Improves Cortical Maladaptive Changes in Advanced Parkinson's Disease</td>
      <td>Background: With the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), pulsatile treatment with oral levodopa causes maladaptive changes within basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits, which are clinically expressed as motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. At the level of the motor cortex, these changes may be detected using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), as abnormal corticospinal and intracortical excitability and absent response to plasticity protocols. Objective: We investigated the effect of continuous dopaminergic stimulation on cortical maladaptive changes related to oral levodopa treatment. Methods: Twenty patients with advanced PD were tested using TMS within 1 week before and again 6 months after the introduction of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel. We measured resting and active motor thresholds, input/output curve, short interval intracortical inhibition curve, cortical silent period, and response to intermittent theta burst stimulation. Patients were clinically assessed with Part III and Part IV of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Results: Six months after the introduction of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel, motor fluctuations scores (P = 0.001) and dyskinesias scores (P &lt; 0.001) were reduced. Resting and active motor threshold (P = 0.012 and P = 0.015) and x-intercept of input/output curve (P = 0.005) were also decreased, while short-interval intracortical inhibition and response to intermittent theta bust stimulation were improved (P = 0.026 and P = 0.031, respectively). Changes in these parameters correlated with clinical improvement. Conclusions: In patients with advanced PD, switching from intermittent to continuous levodopa delivery increased corticospinal excitability and improved deficient intracortical inhibition and abnormal motor cortex plasticity, along with amelioration of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Continuous dopaminergic stimulation ameliorates maladaptive changes inflicted by chronic pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation. © 2022 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.</td>

      <td>Pediatric physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (P-PBPK) models have been used to predict age related changes in the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of renally cleared drugs mainly in relation to changes in glomerular filtration rate. With emerging data on ontogeny of renal transporters, mechanistic models of renal clearance accounting for the role of active and passive secretion should be developed and evaluated. Data on age-related physiological changes and ontogeny of renal transporters were applied into a mechanistic kidney within a P-PBPK model. Plasma concentration–time profile and PK parameters of cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, metformin, tenofovir, and zidovudine were predicted in subjects aged 1 day to 18 years. The predicted and observed plasma concentration–time profiles and PK parameters were compared. The predicted concentration–time profile means and 5th and 95th percent intervals generally captured the observed data and variability in various studies. Overall, based on drugs and age bands, predicted to observed clearance were all within two-fold and in 11 of 16 cases within 1.5-fold. Predicted to observed area under the curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) were within two-fold in 12 of 14 and 12 of 15 cases, respectively. Predictions in neonates and early infants (up to 14 weeks postnatal age) were reasonable with 15–20 predicted PK parameters within two-fold of the observed. ciprofloxacin but not zidovudine PK predictions were sensitive to basal kidney uptake transporter ontogeny. The results indicate that a mechanistic kidney model accounting for physiology and ontogeny of renal processes and transporters can predict the PK of renally excreted drugs in children. Further data especially in neonates are required to verify the model and ontogeny profiles.</td>

      <td>Background and Aims: Evidence suggests that interferon alpha (IFNα) plays an essential role in decreasing the HBsAg quantification and elevating the rate of clinical cure in chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of the exosomes on the expression of host genes in IFNα treatment remain unclear. Methods: CHB patients with IFNα treatment were divided into responders and non-responders according to the degree of HBsAg decline. Through microRNA sequencing and a series of molecular biology methods, the key microRNAs in serum exosomes associated with clinical antiviral response of Peg-IFNα treatment in nucleotide analogue-treated CHB patients were investigated. The roles of exosomal miRNAs on the IFNα signal pathway were explored in macrophages. Results: MicroRNA sequencing and RT-qPCR assays confirmed six distinctly declined miRNAs in serum exosomes of responders at week 12 compared with levels at baseline. Exosomes with declined miR27b-3p in the serum of Peg-IFNα-treated responders activated phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3/7 (IRF3/7) in IFNα synthesis pathway in macrophages. However, miR27b-3p overexpression in HepAD38 cells suppressed IFNα synthesis in macrophages, resulting in insufficient ability to eliminate HBV, whereas the inhibitory effect could be blocked by inhibitors of exosomes release. Luciferase assay showed miR-27b-3p directly suppressed retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) expressions, and these effects could be abrogated in mutation experiments. Conclusions: In IFNα treatment, exosomes with declined miR-27b-3p triggered activation of RIG-I/TBK1 signalling in macrophages against HBV. Serum exosomal miR-27-3p might represent a potential biomarker for patients with CHB.</td>

Trauma, occlusion, and microorganism selection contribute for its etiopathogenesis, which is deemed multifactorial but still incompletely understood. Despite its conspicuous clinical features, awareness of DCPA is apparently low, hence probably overlooked.

Lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP) is a variant of lichen planus (LP) that presents with hyperpigmented macules and patches predominantly in sun-exposed areas. Nail LP is a subtype of LP that can be present alone or with other forms of LP. Case Report: We report a rare case of a 59-year-old woman presenting with symmetrical, gray-brown, hyperpigmented lesions on her neck and face, band-like alopecia in the frontotemporal region, severe onycholysis in two fingernails, and prominent longitudinal ridging in all fingernails. Clinical, dermoscopic, and histological findings established a diagnosis of FFA associated with LPP and nail LP was established. Discussion/Conclusion: In recent years, it has been established that FFA can be associated with LPP and it is thought to be a variant of lichen planopilaris. Nail involvement is rarely reported in FFA or LPP. To our knowledge, the presence of the three conditions in the same patient has not been previously reported. Although rare we would like to emphasize the importance of a careful examination of the nails in patients with FFA and/or LPP to prevent irreversible nail changes.</td>

Secondary outcome measures included the patient-reported Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and visual analog scale (VAS). Four of 5 patients (80%) achieved HiSCR. While improvement was observed in the VAS and DLQI scores of 4 patients, the decline was limited in 1 patient. No adverse event was recorded related to ixekizumab. Conclusion: The result of our observation suggests that ixekizumab may be effective for HS, especially in challenging cases.</td>

      <td>The long-term impact of bloodstream infections on patient and graft survival following kidney transplantation</td>
      <td>Background: There are limited data on the impact of bloodstream infections (BSI) following kidney transplantation (KT) on long term patient outcome. Methods: This was a retrospective parallel-cohort study. We included 123 consecutive KT recipients who were admitted with a first episode of BSI between January 2007 and December, 2016. They were matched with 225 KT recipients who did not have BSI. Multivariate regression analysis with BSI as time-dependent covariate was used for the effect of BSI on graft loss, all-cause mortality and long-term graft function (defined by the slope of mean serum creatinine level). Results: During a median follow-up of 89.4 months, post-transplant BSI was independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR 5.56, 95% CI 3.07–10.09, P &lt;.0001) and graft failure (HR-2.82, 95% CI 1.40–5.64, P =.003) after adjustment for potential confounders. This association remained irrespective of the source of infection or pathogen, but became nonsignificant when appropriate antibiotic therapy was administrated. Baseline kidney function was independently associated with graft failure. Recipients with BSI had lower baseline kidney function; however, the BSI episode had no influence on the slope of change in serum creatinine over time. Conclusion: BSI after KT was associated with long-term adverse outcome. This effect was mitigated by the early administration of appropriate antibiotics.</td>

In the first 2 cases, masses invaded the vertebral canal, causing spinal cord compression. All 3 birds were euthanized given the poor prognosis, and postmortem examinations were performed. The final diagnoses were pulmonary adenocarcinoma in cases 1 and 2, and granulomatous and lymphocytic leptomeningitis caused by Mycobacterium genavense in case 3. MRI enabled visualization of the lesions in the affected area of the CNS, and MRI findings were confirmed by histopathology.</td>

      <td>Antibiotic resistance in foodborne pathogens is an emergent global health concern. The objectives of this study were to assess antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Campylobacter isolates from chicken carcasses and to investigate the AMR molecular mechanisms as well as the presence of virulence determinants. The study was performed on 257 samples collected from abattoirs and retail shops in northeastern Tunisia. Forty-eight Campylobacter isolates were recovered and identified as C. jejuni (n = 33) and C. coli (n = 15). Antibiotic resistance was tested against eight antibiotics and high resistance rates were observed against tetracycline (100%), erythromycin (97.9%), ciprofloxacin (73%), nalidixic acid (85.4%), ampicillin (83.3%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (22.9%), chloramphenicol (75%), and gentamicin (27.1%). All isolates were multidrug-resistant, and 22 resistance patterns were found. All isolates were screened for AMR genes (tet(O), tet(A), tet(B), tet(L), cmeB, ermB, bla(OXA-61), and aphA-3), and for point mutations in gyrA (C257T substitution) and 23SrRNA (A2075G/A2074C) genes. All screened AMR genes, as well as the C257T and the A2075G mutations, were detected. The virulence genotypes were also determined, and all isolates carried the motility (flaA) and invasion (cadF) genes. Most of them also harbored the cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC genes, encoding the Campylobacter toxin. The screening of the cgtB and the wlaN genes, involved in Guillain-Barré Syndrome expression, revealed the presence of the cgtB in 21.2% of C. jejuni strains, whereas none of them carried the wlaN gene. Our findings highlight the emergence of Campylobacter strains simultaneously harboring several virulence and AMR determinants, which emphasizes the risk of transmission of MDR strains to humans via the food chain. Hence, controlling the dissemination of foodborne pathogens “from the farm to the fork” as well as restricting the use of antimicrobials in husbandry are mandatory to prevent the risk for consumers and to mitigate the dissemination of MDR pathogens.</td>

      <td>Escherichia coli is a well-recognized inhabitant of the animal and human gut. Its presence represents an essential component of the microbiome. There are six pathogenic variants of E. coli associated with diarrheal processes, known as pathotypes. These harbor genetic determinants that allow them to be classified as such. In this work, we report the presence of diarrheagenic pathotypes of E. coli strains isolated from healthy donors. Ninety E. coli strains were analyzed, of which forty-six (51%) harbored virulence markers specifics for diarrheagenic pathotypes, including four hybrids (one of them with genetic determinants of three DEC pathotypes). We also identified phylogenetic groups with a higher prevalence of B2 (45.6%) and A (17.8%). In addition, resistance to sulfonamides (100%), and aminoglycosides (100%) was found in 100% of the strains, with a lower prevalence of resistance to cefotaxime (13.3%), ceftriaxone (12.2%), fosfomycin (10%), and meropenem (0%). All analyzed strains were classified as multidrug resistant. Virulence genes were also investigated, which led us to propose three new virotypes. Among the virulence traits observed, the ability to form biofilms stands out, which was superior to that of the E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus strains used as positive controls.</td>

      <td>Molecular Characterization of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Isolated from Intensive Care Unit Patients in Jordanian Hospitals</td>
      <td>Acinetobacter baumannii is a common cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) worldwide, mostly occurring in intensive care units (ICUs). Extended-spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL)positive A. baumannii strains have emerged as highly resistant to most currently used antimicrobial agents, including carbapenems. The most common mechanism for carbapenem resistance in this species is β-lactamase-mediated resistance. Carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D oxacillinases are widespread among multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii strains. The present study was conducted to determine the presence and distribution of bla(OXA) genes among multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolated from ICU patients and genes encoding insertion sequence (IS-1) in these isolates. Additionally, the plasmid DNA profiles of these isolates were determined. A total of 120 clinical isolates of A. baumannii from various ICU clinical specimens of four main Jordanian hospitals were collected. Bacterial isolate identification was confirmed by biochemical testing and antibiotic sensitivity was then assessed. PCR amplification and automated sequencing were carried out to detect the presence of bla(OXA-51), bla(OXA-23), bla(OXA-24), and bla(OXA-58) genes, and ISAba1 insertion sequence. Out of the 120 A. baumannii isolates, 95% of the isolates were resistant to three or more classes of the antibiotics tested and were identified as MDR. The most frequent resistance of the isolates was against piperacillin (96.7%), cephalosporins (97.5%), and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations antibiotics (95.8%). There were 24 (20%) ESBL-producing isolates. A co-existence of bla(OXA-51) gene and ISAba1 in all the 24 ESBL-producing isolates was determined. In addition, in the 24 ESBL-producing isolates, 21 (87.5%) carried bla(OXA-51) and bla(OXA-23) genes, 1 (4.2%) carried bla(OXA-51) and bla(OXA-24), but all were negative for the bla(OXA-58) gene. Plasmid DNA profile A and profile B were the most common (29%) in ESBL-positive MDR A. baumannii isolates while plasmid DNA profile A was the most common in the ESBL-negative isolates. In conclusion, there was an increase in prevalence of MDR-A. baumannii in ICU wards in Jordanian hospitals, especially those having an ESBL phenotype. Thus, identification of ESBL genes is necessary for the surveillance of their transmission in hospitals.</td>

      <td>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is the causative agent of chikungunya fever, a disabling disease that can cause long-term severe arthritis. Since the last large CHIKV outbreak in 2015, the reemergence of the virus represents a serious public health concern. The morbidity associated with viral infection emphasizes the need for the development of specific anti-CHIKV drugs. Herein, we describe the development and characterization of a CHIKV reporter replicon cell line and its use in replicon-based screenings. We tested 960 compounds from MMV/DNDi Open Box libraries and identified four candidates with interesting antiviral activities, which were confirmed in viral infection assays employing CHIKV-nanoluc and BHK-21 cells. The most noteworthy compound identified was itraconazole (ITZ), an orally available, safe, and cheap antifungal, that showed high selectivity indexes of &gt;312 and &gt;294 in both replicon-based and viral infection assays, respectively. The antiviral activity of this molecule has been described against positive-sense single stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) and was related to cholesterol metabolism that could affect the formation of the replication organelles. Although its precise mechanism of action against CHIKV still needs to be elucidated, our results demonstrate that ITZ is a potent inhibitor of the viral replication that could be repurposed as a broad-spectrum antiviral.</td>

Genotype A, sub-genotype A1, was the most common genotype in the study population. A total of 190 mutations were found in the pre-S/S gene area and the acute profile revealed a greater number of nucleotide mutations (p &lt; 0.05). However, both profiles contained nucleotide mutations linked to immune escape and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinomas (acute, A7T; chronic, A7Q). Furthermore, 17 amino acid substitutions were identified in the viral polymerase region, including the drug resistance mutations lamivudine and entecavir (rtL180M), with statistically significant differences between the mutant and wild type strains. Owing to the natural occurrence of these mutations, it is important to screen for resistance mutations before beginning therapy.</td>

      <td>Schizophrenia has been conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental disorder with synaptic alterations and aberrant cortical–subcortical connections. Antipsychotics are the mainstay of schizophrenia treatment and nearly all share the common feature of dopamine D2 receptor occupancy, whereas glutamatergic abnormalities are not targeted by the presently available therapies. D-amino acids, acting as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulators, have emerged in the last few years as a potential augmentation strategy in those cases of schizophrenia that do not respond well to antipsychotics, a condition defined as treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), affecting almost 30–40% of patients, and characterized by serious cognitive deficits and functional impairment. In the present systematic review, we address with a direct and reverse translational perspective the efficacy of D-amino acids, including D-serine, D-aspartate, and D-alanine, in poor responders. The impact of these molecules on the synaptic architecture is also considered in the light of dendritic spine changes reported in schizophrenia and antipsychotics’ effect on postsynaptic density proteins. Moreover, we describe compounds targeting D-amino acid oxidase and D-aspartate oxidase enzymes. Finally, other drugs acting at NMDAR and proxy of D-amino acids function, such as D-cycloserine, sarcosine, and glycine, are considered in the light of the clinical burden of TRS, together with other emerging molecules.</td>

      <td>Prevalence, Antimicrobial Resistance, and Characterization of Staphylococcus aureus Isolated from Subclinical Bovine Mastitis in East Coast Malaysia</td>
      <td>S. aureus is the pathogen that is commonly associated with subclinical mastitis, causing significant economic losses to dairy farms. This infection responds poorly to antimicrobial treat-ment, which could be due to the development of AMR, biofilm formation, and the intracellular invasion of S. aureus into bovine mammary cells leading to treatment failure. Thus, it is important to understand the challenge of this problem. Therefore, the present study aims to determine the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, and characterization of S. aureus that was isolated from sub-clinical bovine mastitis in East Coast Malaysia. A total of 235 milk samples from dairy cows were collected from selected farms in Kelantan and Pahang. The samples were subjected to a somatic cell analysis to identify subclinical mastitis, followed by bacteria isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The isolated S. aureus were further analyzed for their ability to form biofilms and invade the bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T cells) in in vitro infections modeling using a gentamicin protection assay. The overall total of 74/235 (31.4%; 95%CI = 0.31; 0.32) of the milk samples demonstrated &gt;200,000 somatic cells/mL, suggesting the presence of subclinical mastitis in the animals. A total of 39/235 (16.5%; 95% CI = 0.16, 0.17) of the milk samples harbored S. aureus which demonstrated resistance towards the following antimicrobials: penicillin (18/39, 46%), ampicillin (17/39, 43.6%), oxacillin (12/39, 31%), tetracycline (10/39, 26%), and erythromycin (7/39, 18%). AMR was recorded for a total of (17/39, 43.6%) of S. aureus isolates. All isolates formed biofilms, with (8/30, 27%) strongly biofilm-forming, (18/30, 60%) moderately biofilm-forming, and the remaining (4/30, 13%) of isolates weakly biofilm-forming. Interestingly, the AMR isolates appear to produce weak and moderate biofilm. Moreover, (6/20, 30%) of the S. aureus isolates were invasive towards MAC-T cells, as indicated by their ability to evade gentamicin treatment. The study demonstrated the presence of AMR, invasiveness, and biofilm formation in S. aureus that was isolated from sub-clinical mastitis. This characteristic presents additional challenges to existing antimicrobial therapy.</td>

      <td>Melanosomes are melanocyte-specific organelles that protect cells from ultraviolet (UV)-induced deoxyribonucleic acid damage through the production and accumulation of melanin and are transferred from melanocytes to keratinocytes. The relatively well-known process by which melanin is synthesized from melanocytes is known as melanogenesis. The relationship between mel-anogenesis and autophagy is attracting the attention of researchers because proteins associated with autophagy, such as WD repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 1, microtubule-associ-ated protein 1 light chain 3, autophagy-related (ATG)7, ATG4, beclin-1, and UV-radiation re-sistance-associated gene, contribute to the melanogenesis signaling pathway. Additionally, there are reports that some compounds used as whitening cosmetics materials induce skin depigmenta-tion through autophagy. Thus, the possibility that autophagy is involved in the removal of melanin has been suggested. To date, however, there is a lack of data on melanosome autophagy and its underlying mechanism. This review highlights the importance of autophagy in melanin homeosta-sis by providing an overview of melanogenesis, autophagy, the autophagy machinery involved in melanogenesis, and natural compounds that induce autophagy-mediated depigmentation.</td>

The susceptibility of 84 strains of 3 pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus spp., Vibrio spp., and Edwardsiella piscicida) to 18 antibiotics was tested using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) panels, and the distribution of the MIC values for each species was confirmed. Among the panel antibiotics, nine commonly used antibiotics were selected, and the multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index and antibiotic resistance pattern were indicated using the disk diffusion method. It was confirmed that most of the isolates had a MAR index greater than 0.2, indicating a high-risk source. The distribution patterns of the MIC values and resistance pattern between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria showed slightly different results. Ampicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin were more effective against gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria. However, the MIC values of flumequine for gram-positive bacteria were higher than those of gram-negative bacteria. Through the distribution patterns of the MIC values and resistance patterns presented in this study, the need for monitoring the multidrug-resistant bacteria in aquaculture is emphasised.</td>

We calculated these prescription rates overall and on the level of 401 German districts for the calendar years 2010 and 2018. In 2018, the standardized prescription rate of antibiotics in the total study population was 23% lower than in 2010 (442 vs. 575 per 1000 per-sons/year). Among 0–17-year-olds, prescription rates across districts ranged from 312 to 1205 in 2010 and from 188 to 710 in 2018 per 1000 persons/year; among adults (≥18 years), they ranged from 388 to 841 in 2010 and from 300 to 693 in 2018 per 1000 persons/year. Despite the overall decline in outpatient antibiotic prescribing between 2010 and 2018, regional variations at the district level remained high in all age groups in Germany. Identifying reasons that explain the persistently high prescription rates in certain regions will be helpful in designing effective and tailored measures to further improve antibiotic stewardship in these regions.</td>

In the time period 2018–2021, the most frequent serotypes (ST) detected were ST4 (30%) and ST13 (22%). A comparison of the reference period 2006–2013 prior to obligatory routine recording of antimicrobial usage in livestock with the period 2014–2021 resulted in a statistically significant decrease of frequencies of resistant Gps isolates for ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, spectinomycin, tiamulin and tilmicosin. While in 2006–2013 all isolates were resistant for tetracyclin and cephalothin, frequencies of resistant isolates decreased in the second time period to 28% and 62%, respectively. Parallel to the reduction of antimicrobial usage, during recent years a reduction in resistant Gps isolates has been observed, so only a low risk of treatment failure exists. Most frequently, pigs positive for Gps were also positive for S.suis (25.4%), PRRSV-EU (25.1%) and influenza virus (23%). The viral pathogens may act as potential trigger factors.</td>

A prospective observational study was conducted in which 140 urine samples were examined (70 before stenting and 70 after stenting). Bacterial growth was detected in 37 patients (52.8%) before stenting and in 43 patients (61.4%) after stenting.

The proportion of P. aeruginosa strains after stenting grew from 4.4% up to 31.2%. E. coli strains were resistant to ampicillin (92.3% before and 100% after stenting). Three strains of E. coli (23.1%) and six strains of P. aeruginosa (40%) were multidrug-resistant. Determination of the bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics and identification of antibiotic-resistant forms of bacteria is a factor in reducing the risk of complications and optimizing antibiotic therapy during the upper urinary tract stenting.</td>

Recently, urban sewage has increasingly been suggested as a hotspot for AMR even in high-income countries (HICs), where the water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure are well-developed. To understand the current status of AMR in wastewater in a HIC, we reviewed the epidemiological studies on AMR in the sewage environment in Japan from the published literature. Our review showed that a wide variety of clinically important antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and antimicrobial residues are present in human wastewater in Japan. Their concentrations are lower than in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) and are further reduced by sewage treatment plants (STPs) before discharge. Nevertheless, the remaining ARB and ARGs could be an important source of AMR contamination in river water. Furthermore, hospital effluence may be an important reservoir of clinically important ARB. The high concentration of antimicrobial agents commonly prescribed in Japan may contribute to the selection and dissemination of AMR within wastewater. Our review shows the importance of both monitoring for AMR and antimicrobials in human wastewater and efforts to reduce their contamination load in wastewater.</td>

      <td>The Array of Antibacterial Action of Protocatechuic Acid Ethyl Ester and Erythromycin on Staphylococcal Strains</td>
      <td>The spread of antibiotic resistance among bacteria has become one of the major health problems worldwide. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcal strains are especially dangerous because they are often resistant to other antibiotics. The increasing insensitivity to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B antibiotics of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates has limited the use of these drugs in therapy. The combination of natural compounds and antibiotics can be considered as an alternative tool to fight multi-drug-resistant pathogen infections. The aim of the presented study was to examine the antibacterial activity of protocatechuic acid ethyl ester–erythromycin combination towards Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains with various resistance profiles to methicillin and macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (MLS(B)) antibiotics. The in-vitro an-tibacterial potential of the above combination was investigated by minimum inhibitory concentration assays and checkerboard testing. The observed effects were strain dependent, with 8 of 12 tested staphylococcal strains showing an indifferent effect on the natural compound and erythromycin; for 2 strains, the tested combination had an additive effect, while for another 2, the effect was synergistic. Interestingly, the multi-drug-resistant strains were more sensitive to the cooperative action of the protocatechuic acid ethyl ester and the antibiotic.</td>

      <td>Surgical Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in Neonates and Children Undergoing Neurosurgery: A RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method Consensus Study</td>
      <td>Pediatric neurosurgery is a highly specialized branch of surgery in which surgical site infections (SSIs) are potentially serious complications that can also adversely affect a good surgical outcome, compromising functional recovery and, in some cases, even putting the patient’s life at risk. The main aim of this consensus document is to provide clinicians with a series of recommendations on antimicrobial prophylaxis for neonates and children undergoing neurosurgery. The following scenarios were considered: (1) craniotomy or cranial/cranio-facial approach to craniosynostosis; (2) neurosurgery with a trans-nasal-trans-sphenoidal approach; (3) non-penetrating head injuries; (4) penetrating head fracture; (5) spinal surgery (extradural and intradural); (6) shunt surgery or neuroendoscopy; (7) neuroendovascular procedures. Patients undergoing neurosurgery often undergo peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis, with different schedules, not always supported by scientific evidence. This consensus provides clear and shared indications, based on the most updated literature. This work has been made possible by the multidisciplinary contribution of experts belonging to the most important Italian scientific societies, and represents, in our opinion, the most complete and up-to-date collection of recommendations on the behavior to be held in the perioperative setting in this type of intervention, in order to guide physicians in the management of the patient, standardize approaches and avoid abuse and misuse of antibiotics.</td>

      <td>Indirect and Direct Effects of SARS-CoV-2 on Human Pancreatic Islets</td>
      <td>Recent studies have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may induce metabolic distress, leading to hyperglycemia in patients affected by coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). We investigated the potential indirect and direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 on human pancreatic islets in 10 patients who became hyperglycemic after COVID-19. Although there was no evidence of peripheral anti-islet autoimmu- nity, the serum of these patients displayed toxicity on human pancreatic islets, which could be abrogated by the use of anti-interleukin-1 β (IL- β), anti-IL-6, and anti-tu- mor necrosis factor a, cytokines known to be highly upre- gulated during COVID-19. Interestingly, the receptors of those aforementioned cytokines were highly expressed on human pancreatic islets. An increase in peripheral unmethylated INS DNA, a marker of cell death, was evi- dent in several patients with COVID-19. Pathology of the pancreas from deceased hyperglycemic patients who had COVID-19 revealed mild lymphocytic infiltration of pancreatic islets and pancreatic lymph nodes. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-specrfic viral RNA, along with the presence of several immature insulin granules or proinsulin, was detected in postmortem pancreatic tissues, suggestive of β-cell-attered proinsulin processing, as well as β-cell degeneration and hyperstimulation. These data demon- strate that SARS-CoV-2 may negatively affect human pancreatic islet function and survival by creating inflam- matory conditions, possibly with a direct tropism, which may in turn lead to metabolic abnormalities observed in patie nts with COVID-19.</td>

      <td>Background: The olive tree (Olea europaea L.), the most widespread plant species in the Mediterranean basin, includes two forms: cultivated (var Europaea) and wild (var Sylvestris). Wild olive trees or oleasters cover large areas in Algeria. It has been shown that oil from oleaster has a higher content of phenolic compounds, which could have antimicrobial properties. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the antibacterial activity of phenolic extracts from four Algerian oleaster oils and an extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) from Chemlal variety. Methods: Phenolic compounds were determined by UHPLC-MS. Antibacterial activity was tested against six referenced human enteropathogenic bacteria by the agar disc diffusion method by mea-suring the diameters of the zone of inhibition. Results: The results revealed a similarity between the phenolic composition of oleasters 1 and 3 and between oleaster 4 and EVOO; however, the phenolic composition of oleaster 2 that the poorer was markedly different with a higher content of free phenolic alcohols and lower in secoiridoids. Almost all bacteria showed to be sensitive against the antibiotics, with the value of ZOI ranging from 5-32 mm; otherwise, most of the oleaster extracts exhibited higher antibacterial activity than the EVOO with ZOI values of 7-12mm. A significant correlation was noted between phenolic content and antibacterial activity. Conclusion: These results show that oleaster oil can be considered a high potential food.</td>

      <td>Background: Since 2012, few reports on the molecular epidemiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported in Tunisia. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate carbapenem-resistance determinants and molecular epidemiology and to compare the carbapenemase-phenotypic detection methods of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates. Methods: During a period of four years (2014 to 2017), all imipenem-ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates were retrospectively selected at the microbial laboratory of Charles Nicolle hospital of Tunis. These isolates were examined by the modified Hodge test, modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM), and another mCIM, called CIMTris, and their performance was evaluated using PCR analysis as the gold standard. Results: A total of 35 isolates were recovered among patients hospitalized in different units. All strains were colistin-susceptible.All carbapenem-resistant isolates showed a high-level resistance to carbapenems. CIMTris and mCIM showed 96.15% and 46.15% sensitivity and 44.44% and 100% specificity, respectively, for detecting carbapenemase production.Conclusions: CIMTris is a promising approach for detecting carbapenemase activity in P. aeruginosa and merits further testing. Moreover, this study described the first detection of GES-5-and GES-9-producing P. aeruginosa in Tunisia as well as the co-occurrence of the bla(GES-5) and bla(VIM-11) carbapenemase genes in one isolate. These findings are of great concern because the rapid dissemination of MDR strains represents a major therapeutic and epidemiological threat.</td>

      <td>In this study, we isolated eight strains of Candida albicans from the blowhole air cultures of eight dolphins (one Pacific white-sided dolphin and seven bottlenose dolphins) housed at the Enoshima Aquarium. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of antifungals for these isolates were determined by conducting E-test and broth microdilution assays using the CLSI M27-A3 protocol antifungal susceptibility testing method. Only one of the eight dolphins from which Candida had been isolated had been treated with amphotericin B (AMB), and four had been treated with itraconazole (ITZ). All isolates were identified as Candida albicans, and all were resistant to both ITZ and voriconazole, though the isolates exhibited susceptibility to AMB and micafungin. Based on our findings, we suspect that the frequency of occurrence of azole-resistant Candida species is increasing in captive dolphins as well as in their aquarium environments.</td>

      <td>This study was organized to investigate the prevalence, antibiotic and disinfectant resistance phenotypes and genotypes as well as plasmid profiles of Shigella species isolated from raw cow milk and milk products in Egypt. Genotypic analysis was performed to determine the presence of β-lactamase encoding genes (bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M), bla(OXA-1) and bla(SHV) ), tet(A) and qacE∆. Forty-two (7%) Shigella isolates (S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, and S. sonnei) were recovered, with S. dysenteriae as the predominant type. Antibiotic sensitivity tests showed that 71.4% of Shigella isolates were resistant to three or more antibiotic classes (multidrug-resistant). High resistance rates were observed against tetracyclines (100%), ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate (90.5%, each) and cefaclor (66.7%), while no resistance was detected against imipenem, sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim, and azithromycin. Disinfectant susceptibility test of Shigella isolates revealed resistance to phenolic compound (vanillic acid), while 85.7% of the Shigella isolates were resistant to benzalkonium chloride. Uniplex PCR analysis declared the existence of β-lactamase encoding genes (bla(TEM) in all isolates and bla(CTX-M) in 28.6% of isolates) and, tet(A) in all isolates and 85.7% of the isolates were positive for qacE∆1, while all isolates were negative for bla(OXA-1) and bla(SHV). All Shigella extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) producers (12, 100%) were positive for the bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M), and qacE∆1 genes. Furthermore, plasmid profiling revealed seven distinct plasmid patterns (P1–P7), ranging from 1.26 to 33.61 kb, among all the Shigella strains; S. dysenteriae exhibited the greatest variance. The co-transfer of β-lactamase genes (bla(TEM) and bla(CTX-M) ) and qacE∆1 genes was observed by conjugation from all ESBL producers to a recipient strain. These findings indicate the emergence of Shigella species in Egypt that exhibited multi-resistance to either antibiotics (particularly ESBL producer strains) or disinfectants. Thus, the resistance of Shigella species should regularly be monitored and appropriate measures should be taken to manage this problem.</td>

      <td>Survey and Analysis of Chemoprophylaxis Policies for Domestic Travel in Malaria-Endemic Countries</td>
      <td>The prevention of malaria in travelers with the use of antimalarials often occurs in connection with international travel to areas of significant risk of infection. Although these travelers sometimes cause outbreaks in their malaria-free home countries, the cardinal objective of prescribed chemoprophylaxis is to protect the traveler from patent malaria during travel. Here we consider the chemoprophylaxis of domestic travelers from malaria-free but-receptive areas within malaria-endemic countries. The main objective in this setting is the protection of those areas from reintroduced malaria transmission. In order to better understand policy and practices in this regard, we surveyed malaria prevention and treatment guidelines of 36 malaria-endemic countries and 2 that have recently eliminated malaria (Sri Lanka, China) for recommendations regarding malaria chemoprophylaxis for domestic travel. Among them, just 8 provided specific and positive recommendations, 1 recom-mended without specific guidance, and 4 advised against the practice. Most nations (25/38; 66%) did not mention chemoprophylaxis for domestic travel, though many of those did offer guidance for international travel. The few positive recommendations for domestic travel were dominated by the suppressive prophylaxis options of daily doxycycline or atovaquone-proguanil or weekly mefloquine. The incomplete protection afforded by these strategies, along with impractical dosing in connection with the typically brief domestic travel, may in part explain the broad lack of policies and practices across malaria-endemic nations regarding chemoprophylaxis.</td>

      <td>The Multistage Antimalarial Compound Calxinin Perturbates P. falciparum Ca(2+) Homeostasis by Targeting a Unique Ion Channel</td>
      <td>Malaria elimination urgently needs novel antimalarial therapies that transcend resistance, toxicity, and high costs. Our multicentric international collaborative team focuses on developing multistage antimalarials that exhibit novel mechanisms of action. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a novel multistage antimalarial compound, ‘Calxinin’. A compound that consists of hydroxyethylamine (HEA) and trifluoromethyl‐benzyl‐piperazine. Calxinin exhibits potent inhibitory activity in the nanomolar range against the asexual blood stages of drug‐sensitive (3D7), multidrug‐resistant (Dd2), artemisinin‐resistant (IPC4912), and fresh Kenyan field isolated Plasmodium falciparum strains. Calxinin treatment resulted in diminished maturation of parasite sexual precursor cells (gametocytes) accompanied by distorted parasite morphology. Further, in vitro liver‐stage testing with a mouse model showed reduced parasite load at an IC50 of 79 nM. A single dose (10 mg/kg) of Calxinin resulted in a 30% reduction in parasitemia in mice infected with a chloroquine‐resistant strain of the rodent parasite P. berghei. The ex vivo ookinete inhibitory concentration within mosquito gut IC50 was 150 nM. Cellular in vitro toxicity assays in the primary and immortalized human cell lines did not show cytotoxicity. A computational protein target identification pipeline identified a putative P. falciparum membrane protein (Pf3D7_1313500) involved in parasite calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostasis as a potential Calxinin target. This highly conserved protein is related to the family of transient receptor potential cation channels (TRP‐ML). Target validation experiments showed that exposure of parasitized RBCs (pRBCs) to Calxinin induces a rapid release of intracellular Ca(2+) from pRBCs; leaving de‐calcinated parasites trapped in RBCs. Overall, we demonstrated that Calxinin is a promising antimalarial lead compound with a novel mechanism of action and with potential therapeutic, prophylactic, and transmission‐blocking properties against parasites resistant to current antimalarials.</td>

      <td>Combinations of two different therapeutic modalities of VEGF inhibitors against angiogenesis can cooperatively impede breast cancer tumor growth and enhance therapeutic efficacy. Itraconazole (ITZ) is a conventional antifungal drug with high safety; however, it has been repurposed to be a multi target anti-angiogenesis agent for cancer therapy in recent years. In the present study, composite nanoparticles co-loaded with ITZ and VEGF siRNA were prepared in order to investigate their anti-angiogenesis efficacy and synergistic anticancer effect against breast cancer. The nanoparticles had a suitable particle size (117.9 ± 10.3 nm) and weak positive surface charge (6.69 ± 2.46 mV), as well as good stability and drug release profile in vitro. Moreover, the nanoparticles successfully escaped from endosomes and realized cell apoptosis and cell proliferation inhibition in vitro. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the nanoparticles could induce the silencing of VEGF-related expressions as well as anti-angiogenesis efficacy, and the co-loaded ITZ-VEGF siRNA NPs could inhibit tumor growth effectively with low toxicity and side effects. Taken together, the as-prepared delivery vehicles are a simple and safe nano-platform that improves the antitumor efficacy of VEGF siRNA and ITZ, which allows the repositioning of the generic drug ITZ as a great candidate for antitumor therapy.</td>

      <td>Seasonal Pollution Characteristics of Antibiotics on Pig Farms of Different Scales</td>
      <td>Scientific interest in pollution from veterinary antibiotics (VAs) on intensive animal farms has been increasing in recent years. However, limited information is available on the seasonal pollution characteristics and the associated ecological risks of VAs, especially about the different scale farms. Therefore, this study investigated the seasonal pollution status and ecological risks of 42 typical VAs (5 classes) on three different scale pig farms (breeding scales of about 30,000, 1200, and 300 heads, respectively) in Tianjin, China. The results showed that large-scale pig farms usually had the highest antibiotic pollution levels, followed by small-scale pig farms and medium-scale pig farms. Among different seasons, antibiotic contamination was more severe in winter and spring than that in the other seasons. Tetracyclines (TCs) usually had higher proportions (over 51.46%) and the residual concentration detected in manure, and wastewater samples ranged from not detected (ND)-1132.64 mg/kg and ND-1692.50 µg/L, respectively, which all occurred for oxytetracycline (OTC) during winter. For the antibiotic ecological risks in the effluent, we found high-risk level of 12 selected VAs accounted for 58% in spring, and 7 kinds of VAs were selected in the amended soil, but nearly all the antibiotics had no obvious ecological risks except OTC (spring and summer). All these data provided an insight into the seasonal variability and the associated ecological risks of antibiotics on intensive pig farms, which can provide scientific guidance on decreasing antibiotic contamination to enhance environmental security in similar areas.</td>

Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of patients with P. aeruginosa bloodstream infection (BSI). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we retrospectively evaluated the records of 35 patients with P. aeruginosa BSI admitted to the Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, during 2012-2015. Age, sex, clinical symptoms, risk factors, underlying diseases, and the antibiogram test results were recorded and compared between nosocomial and community-acquired infection (CAI) dead and alive patients using the chi-square test. Data were analyzed using SPSS software, version 21. Results: The patients had a mean age of 54.57 ± 20.75 years, with 19 of them being men (54.3%). Intubation was only required in the deceased group (N = 19; P = 0.014). Tachypnea was more frequent (63.2% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.003), and appropriate treatment was less frequent (27.8% vs. 66.7%; P = 0.02) in the deceased group compared to the control group. Most patients with nosocomial infection (N = 24) passed away (66.7%; P = 0.03). All nine patients with a history of burning had a nosocomial infection (P = 0.01). Shivering and decreased consciousness were more frequent in patients with CAI (both P = 0.03) than in other patients. The antibiogram test results showed high resistance to multiple antibiotics. Conclusions: Considering the high mortality rate of P. aeruginosa BSI and resistance to multiple antibiotics, it is necessary to pay greater attention to the prevention of nosocomial infection with this pathogen, especially in patients admitted to burn centers and those with specific clinical signs, like tachypnea and leukocytosis.</td>

Findings One thousand two hundred and ninety nine inhabitants of Kyela district in Southwest Tanzania aged 14 to 65 years who had participated in the study activities in 2009 were revisited in 2010/11 and 2019. Among this group, the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis of the 14–65 years olds in 2009 was 35.1%. A follow-up evaluation in 2010/11 had shown a reduction to 27.7%. In 2019, after 7 years of annual treatment and an additional three years of surveil-lance, the prevalence had dropped to 1.7%, demonstrating successful treatment by the national control programme. Risk factors for W. bancrofti-infection were the occupation as farmer, male sex, and older age. Most infected individuals in the 2019 follow-up study already had a positive test for filarial antigen in 2009 and/or 2010/11. Conclusions This data supports the findings of the Tanzanian Neglected Tropical Disease Control Programme (NTDCP), who conducted Transmission Assessment Surveys and found an impressive reduction in the prevalence of LF in children. Our results complement this data by showing a similar decrease in prevalence of LF in the adult population in the same area. The elimination of LF seems achievable in the near future.</td>

      <td>Partial masculinization of Aedes aegypti females by conditional expression of Nix</td>
      <td>Background Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue, yellow fever, and other arboviruses thrives in tropical and subtropical areas around the globe putting half of the world’s population at risk. Despite aggressive efforts to control the transmission of those viruses, an unacceptable number of cases occur every year, emphasizing the need to develop new control strategies. Proposals for vector control focused on population suppression could offer a feasible alternative method to reduce disease transmission. The induction of extreme male-biased sex ratios has been hypothesized to be able to suppress or collapse a population, with previous experiments showing that stable expression of the male determining factor Nix in A. aegypti is sufficient to convert females into fertile males. Methodology/Principal findings Here, we report on the conditional expression of Nix in transgenic A. aegypti under the control of the tetracycline-dependent (Tet-off) system, with the goal of establishing repressible sex distortion. A masculinization phenotype was observed in three of the seven transgenic lines with females exhibiting male-like long maxillary palps and most importantly, the masculinized females were unable to blood feed. Doxycycline treatment of the transgenic lines only partially restored the normal phenotype from the masculinized transgenic lines, while RT-qPCR analysis of early embryos or adults showed no correlation between the level of masculinization and ectopic Nix expression. Conclusions/Significance While the conditional expression of Nix produced intersex phenotypes, the level of expression was insufficient to program full conversion. Modifications that increase both the level of activation (no tet) and the level of repression (with tet) will be necessary, as such this study represents one step forward in the development of genetic strategies to control vector-borne diseases via sex ratio distortion.</td>

      <td>Paenibacilli are gram-variable, endospore-forming bacteria that occupy various ecologic niches. These microorganisms have been known to infect humans occasionally at various anatomic sites. However, in humans, as well as in other vertebrate animals, the relationship between disease and isolation of Paenibacillus spp. remains poorly understood. We report here a case of infection in an adult Poodle dog. The animal had nodules in the lungs and multifocal osteolytic expansile bone lesions. From bone, Paenibacillus amylolyticus was recovered by culture and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and 16S rDNA sequencing; pyogranulomatous inflammation was observed in lung and bone specimens. The microorganism was resistant to clindamycin and imipenem. Four-month treatment with amoxicillin–clavulanate resulted in clinical resolution of disease in this dog. Nevertheless, therapy for more prolonged periods should be considered because recurrent infections can occur as a result of the transition of Paenibacillus spores to vegetative cells. Disease caused by a Paenibacillus species has not been reported previously in dogs, to our knowledge.</td>

      <td>Altered gut microbiota and metabolites profile are associated with reduced bone metabolism in ethanol-induced osteoporosis</td>
      <td>Objective: Chronic heavy drinking causes ethanol-induced osteoporosis (EIO). The present study aimed to explore the role of GM in EIO. Material and Methods: A rat EIO model was established by chronic ethanol intake. Taking the antibiotic application as the matched group of dysbacteriosis, an integrated 16S rRNA sequencing and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolomics in serum and faeces were applied to explore the association of differential metabolic phenotypes and screen out the candidate metabolites detrimental to ossification. The colon organoids were used to track the source of 5-HT and the effect of 5-HT on bone formation was examined in vitro. Results: Compared with antibiotics application, ethanol-gavaged decreased the BMD in rats. We found that both ethanol and antibiotic intake affected the composition of GM, but ethanol intake increased the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. Elevated serotonin was proved to be positively correlated with the changes of the composition of GM and faecal metabolites and inhibited the proliferation and mineralization of osteogenesis-related cells. However, the direct secretory promotion of serotonin was absent in the colon organoids exposed to ethanol. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that ethanol consumption led to osteoporosis and intestinal-specific dysbacteriosis. Conjoint analysis of the genetic profiles of GM and metabolic phenotypes in serum and faeces allowed us to understand the endogenous metabolite, 5-HT, as detrimental regulators in the gut-bone axis to impair bone formation.</td>

      <td>Objectives: Acinetobacter Baumannii is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen belonging to the Moraxellaceae family. The emergence of multidrug resistant strains of this pathogen caused many problems for hospitals and patients. The aim of the current study was to isolate, identify, and morphologically, physiologically, and in vivo analyze a new lytic bacteriophage targeting extensively drug-resistant (XDR) A. baumannii. Materials and Methods: Different wastewater samples were tested for isolation of lytic bacteriophage against 19 A. baumannii isolates obtained from patients hospitalized in a hospital in Arak, Iran, from January 2019 to March 2019. The phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of A. baumannii strains (resistance genes including: adeA, adeB, adeC, adeR, adeS, ISAba1, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24) were analyzed. The isolated phage characteristics including adsorption time, pH and thermal stability, host range, one-step growth rate, electron microscopy examination, and therapeutic efficacy of the phage were also investigated. Therapeutic efficacy of the phage was evaluated in a rat model with burn infection of XDR A. baumannii. The lesion image was taken on different days after burning and infection induction and was compared with phage untreated lesions. Results: The results showed unique characteristics of the isolated phage (vB-AbauM-Arak1) including high specificity for Acinetobacter baumannii, stability at a relatively wide range of temperatures and pH values, short adsorption time, short latent period, and large burst size. In relation to the therapeutic efficacy of the phage, the lesion area decreased in phage-treated groups over 14 days than in those untreated, significantly (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that isolated lytic phage was able to eliminate burn infections caused by XDR A. baumannii in a rat model. So, it may be recommended as alternative options toward to developing a treatment for extensively drug resistant Acinetobacter infections.</td>

      <td>Background: The clinical isolation rates of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) continue to increase. In China, clinical CR-KP isolates are mainly attributed to the bla(KPC-2) gene carried on plasmids, and the bla(KPC-2) copy number correlates with the expression of KPC enzymes, which can cause elevated carbapenem MICs. Methods: Thirty-seven CR-KP isolates were collected at the Second People’s Hospital of Lianyungang City between January 2020 and March 2021, with no duplicate isolates, and were screened for the bla(KPC-2) gene with PCR. Analysis of current CRKP resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials using the bioMérieux VITEK(®) 2 bacterial identification card. The multilocus sequence types of the strains were confirmed with PCR and DNA sequencing. Recombinant plasmids pET20b-bla(KPC-2) and pET20b-CpsG were constructed, and the copy numbers of the recombinant plasmids per unit volume was calculated based on the molecular weight of the plasmids. After the genomes DNA of clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae carrying the bla(KPC-2) gene were purified, the bla(KPC-2) gene relative copy number in individual K. pneumoniae strains was indicated by the double standard curve method. Detection of MIC values changes of K. pneumoniae under imipenem selection pressure by broth microdilution method. Results: Among the 37 CR-KP strains isolated, only the bla(KPC-2) gene was detected in 30 strains, three strains were positive for the bla(NDM-1) gene, two strains carried both the bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-1) genes, and two strains without detectable carbapenem resistance genes. The ST11 clone was predominant among the 37 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates. Drug sensitivity testing showed that except for polymyxins (100% susceptible) and tigecycline (75.7% intermediate), the 37 CR-KP strains were resistant to almost all antimicrobial drugs. The bla(KPC-2) relative copy number in nine ST11 clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae was 7.64 ± 2.51 when grown on LB plates but 27.67 ± 13.04 when grown on LB plates containing imipenem. Among these nine isolates, five CRKP strains exhibited elevated MICs to imipenem, while the remaining four strains showed unchanged MIC values to imipenem. Conclusion: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates may have multiple pathways to achieve high levels of carbapenem resistance, and moderate carbapenem pressure can increase the copy number of KPC enzyme genes in CRKP strains and enhance the degree of carbapenem resistance in the strains.</td>

      <td>Background: Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a common chronic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of salivary and lacrimal glands. The current study was performed to investigate the roles of follicular helper T (Tfh) and follicular regulatory T (Tfr) subsets in patients with pSS, and to evaluate the effects of sirolimus on these cells. Methods: Levels of circulating Tfh and Tfr subsets in 58 pSS patients and 26 healthy controls (HC) were determined by flow cytometry. These T cell subsets were also analyzed in 12 patients before and after treatment with sirolimus. Clinical features and correlations with follicular T cells were analyzed systematically. The discriminative ability of the cells and ratios was evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: Patients with pSS had higher percentage and absolute number of PD-1+ICOS+Tfh cells, while lower percentage and absolute number of Tfr, activated regulatory T (aTreg) cells, and CD45RA-Foxp3(high) activated Tfr cells. Furthermore, increased number of PD-1+ICOS+Tfh cells was associated with B cells, while decreased numbers of Tfr and their subsets was strongly associated with aTreg cells in pSS patients. Also, the higher proportion of PD-1+ICOS+Tfh cells was positively correlated with higher level of autoantibodies, ESR, IgG, cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-21 and sIL-2αR), and disease activity. Unexpectedly, the elevated PD-1+ICOS+Tfh:CD45RA-Foxp3(high) activated Tfr ratio had the greatest ability to discriminate between pSS and HC, and sirolimus therapy restored the PD-1+ICOS+Tfh cells:CD45RA-Foxp3(high) activated Tfr ratio, and controlled disease activity. Conclusion: The novel ratio of PD-1+ICOS+Tfh to CD45RA-Foxp3(high) activated Tfr cells can effectively discriminate the pSS patients from controls, and Tfr cell subsets may resemble Treg cell lineages. Furthermore, the PD-1+ICOS+Tfh cells can be used as a biomarker of disease activity and to verify the therapeutic effects of sirolimus in pSS.</td>

      <td>Predictors of Treatment Change Among Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis Treated with TNF Inhibitors as First-Line Biologic Agent in the USA: A Cohort Study from Longitudinal Electronic Health Records</td>
      <td>Background: Previous observational studies utilizing administrative claims data have largely been unable to consider clinical factors that may be related to patterns of drug use among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Objective: To understand predictors of treatment changes following initiation of a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) using nation-wide electronic health record (EHR) data in the USA. Methods: The Optum Immunology Condition EHR data (01/01/2011–09/30/2019) was used to identify a population of adult patients with RA initiating a TNFi as the first line biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). The primary outcome was any treatment change during the 1-year post-index period defined as cycling to a different TNFi or switching to non-TNFi biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Secondary outcomes were the individual components of TNFi cycling and switching, examined separately. To identify predictors of DMARD treatment changes, we used a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. Model c-statistics and odds ratios (ORs, 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) of predictors were reported. Results: We identified 24,871 patients with RA who initiated a TNFi. The mean age was 55.5 (± 13.7) years and 77.2% were female. Among the TNFi initiators, 22.2% experienced TNFi cycling or switching during the 1-year follow-up time. Predictors that are associated with higher likelihood of TNFi cycling or switching included female gender (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.16–1.36) and glucocorticoid use (OR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.21–1.40). In contrast, inflammatory bowel disease (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.48–0.78), psoriasis (OR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70–0.95), recent use of methotrexate (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81–0.97), and vitamin D intake (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85–0.99) were negatively associated with TNFi cycling or switch. Conclusions: Gender, glucocorticoid use, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and vitamin D intake were identified as significant predictors of TNFi cycling or switching for TNFi initiators in the RA population. Predicting treatment change remains challenging even with large detailed EHR data. Plain Language Summary: This study aimed to identify key determinants of treatment changes among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) initiating atumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) as their first-line biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) in routinecare settings using a US nation-wide longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Among 24,871 patients with RA who initiateda TNFi, 22.2% experienced TNFi cycling or switching during the 1-year follow-up time. Female patients and those who usedglucocorticoids were more likely to experience TNFi cycling or switching, whereas inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis,recent methotrexate use, and vitamin D intake were negatively associated with the outcome. However, predicting treatmentchange remains challenging even with larger detailed EHR data potentially due to unmeasured factors such as prescriber’spreference or patient’s belief in the medication.</td>

      <td>The history and pharmacology of buprenorphine: New advances in cats</td>
      <td>Opiates have a long history of medical use as effective analgesics associated with well-described side effects, including euphoria, respiratory depression, constipation, bradycardia, and histamine release, among others. The search for opiate analogs that retain effective analgesic qualities without detrimental side effects has yielded numerous compounds, including buprenorphine. Early studies of buprenorphine demonstrated analgesic effectiveness with a favorable safety profile, leading to the approval of formulations for use in humans. Since then, advances in receptor theory and molecular cloning of opioid receptors have led to a deeper understanding of buprenorphine pharmacology. More recent studies of receptor affinity and intrinsic activity have shown that buprenorphine is a μ- and κ-opioid receptor agonist, a nociceptin orphanin peptide agonist, and a δ-opioid receptor antagonist. Buprenorphine appears to have a primary spinal analgesic mechanism with complex supraspinal actions. It is considered a full agonist for pain but a partial agonist for other clinical endpoints such as respiratory depression. In feline medicine, buprenorphine is approved as low- and high-concentration injectable solutions, in addition to the most recently introduced long-acting transdermal formulation. Several investigational and compounded formulations have also been evaluated. There are contrasting differentiable features that include pharmacokinetics, onsets- and durations-of-action, routes of administration, and formulation constituents. Available buprenorphine formulations allow clinicians to select a formulation based on the anticipated duration of pain associated with various surgical procedures, and to provide interventions as needed. In light of the newly approved transdermal buprenorphine solution in cats and progress in buprenorphine pharmacology, the objective of this review is to examine the history and pharmacology of buprenorphine relative to full opioid agonists, where appropriate, integrating these insights into advances within feline medicine.</td>

      <td>Feasibility and Efficacy of Partially Replacing Post-Transplantation Cyclophosphamide with Bendamustine in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients Undergoing Haploidentical Bone Marrow Transplantation</td>
      <td>Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) is the most widely applied graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimen in T-cell replete haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (haplo-BMT). Although PT-CY has met with great success in the haplo-BMT arena by suppressing GVHD, patients without acute GVHD have high relapse rates. One strategy to reduce relapse rates being explored by others is a dosage reduction of PT-CY. We have taken a different approach in evaluating whether partially replacing PT-CY with post-transplantation bendamustine (PT-BEN) would be advantageous, an idea based on our preclinical research identifying several beneficial immunomodulatory properties of BEN. We therefore initiated and completed a Phase Ia trial to evaluate the progressive substitution of PT-CY with PT-BEN (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02996773). We compared outcomes between 13 patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies who received PT-CY/BEN and 31 contemporaneous haplo-BMT recipients treated with the same myeloablative conditioning regimens but receiving only PT-CY. We found that partial replacement of PT-CY with PT-BEN (PT-CY/BEN) on day +4 was well tolerated and associated with significantly earlier trilineage engraftment. We also report favorable trends toward significant improvements on univariate and multivariate analyses with PT-CY/BEN compared with PT-CY with respect to rates of chronic GVHD (hazard ratio [HR], .08; 95% confidence interval [CI], .005 to 1.11; P = .06), and GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) (HR, .22; 95% CI, .05 to .86; P = .039). Our human trial has now transitioned to Phase Ib, which will further evaluate the safety and potential benefits of PT-CY/BEN. Herein we also expand our pediatric, adolescent, and young adult experience to 31 patients, demonstrating overall survival, progression-free survival, and GRFS at 3 years of 85.6%, 76.1%, and 58.2%, respectively, in a largely racial/ethnic minority cohort. PT-CY/BEN appears to be a promising treatment option that requires further evaluation.</td>

The present study was designed to assess the effect of risperidone on NT-3 and MMP-9 levels in patients with schizophrenia spectrum of disorder and to investigate whether these markers can be used to predict the treatment response in these patients. 62 schizophrenia spectrum of disorder patients were enrolled in the study and were treated with 4 mg of risperidone OD. Serum NT-3 and MMP-9 levels were compared at baseline and after 6 weeks following risperidone treatment. Severity of the disease was assessed using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). MMP-9 was significantly reduced and NT-3 was significantly increased in schizophrenia spectrum of disorder after treatment with risperidone. We also found a significant reduction in MMP-9 levels in the non-responders group. At a cut off of 1225 ng/mL, MMP-9 can predict response to treatment with 64% sensitivity and 62% specificity and at a cut off of 957 pg/mL, NT-3 predicted the response to treatment with 60% sensitivity and 62% specificity. We conclude that risperidone decreases the serum levels of MMP-9 and increases the NT-3 levels in schizophrenia spectrum of disorder.

Immune response of these parasites interact and their interactions could have repercussions on vaccine development and efficacy. The current goal of hookworm eradication lies on vaccination. We evaluated the effect of P. falciparum coinfection and albendazole treatment on naturally acquired antibody profile against hookworm L3 stage larvae antigen. Methods: In a longitudinal study, 40 individuals infected with Necator americanus only, 63 participants infected with N. americanus and P. falciparum, and 36 nonendemic controls (NECs) were recruited. The study was done in the Kintampo North Metropolis of Ghana. Stool and blood samples were taken for laboratory analyses. Serum samples were obtained before hookworm treatment and 3 weeks after treatment. Results: The malaria-hookworm (N. americanus and P. falciparum) coinfected subjects had significantly higher levels of IgE (β = 0.30, 95% CI = [0.12, 0.48], p = 0.023) and IgG3 (β = 0.15, 95% CI = [0.02, 0.52], p = 0.004) compared to those infected with hookworm only (N. americanus). The N. americanus groups had significantly higher levels of IgG3 (β = 0.39, 95% CI = [0.14–0.62], p = 0.002) compared to the control group. Similarly, N. americanus and P. falciparum coinfected participants had significantly higher levels of IgE (β = 0.35, 95% CI = [0.70–0.39], p = 0.002) and IgG3 (β = 0.54, 95% CI = [0.22–0.76], p = 0.002). Moreover, albendazole treatment led to a significant reduction in IgE, IgA, IgM, and IgG3 antibodies against hookworm L3 stage larvae (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: P. falciparum is associated with improved IgE and IgG response against hookworm L3 stage larvae. Treatment with single dose of albendazole led to reduction in naturally acquired immune response against hookworm infection. Thus, P. falciparum infection may have a boosting effect on hookworm vaccine effectiveness.</td>

      <td>Salmonella Thompson, an important foodborne pathogen, is rarely found to be pathogenic to poultry. Accidentally, S. Thompson was found to be pathogenic to embryos of white feather broiler at a poultry farm in China. Therefore, this study aimed to explore antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity of clinical S. Thompson isolated from dead poultry embryos. The phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA and seven housekeeping genes showed that the 14 clinical S. Thompson were closely related. The core-genome multilocus sequence typing of 14 clinical S. Thompson based on whole-genome sequencing was cgST-12774, consistent with the only two strains of S. Thompson from humans in China as reported in the NCBI database. The antimicrobial resistance gene analysis demonstrated that all strains carried aac(6′)-Iaa and the polymyxin resistance gene mcr-9. Antimicrobial sensitivity tests for 18 antibiotics showed that S. Thompson isolates displayed resistance against streptomycin (100%), ampicillin (35.7%), and doxycycline (14.3%), but sensitivity to polymyxin B, proving that the mcr-9 gene had not appeared resistance phenotype. Virulence genes Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI) SPI1-5, type I fimbriae gene (fimA), flagellar assembly genes (bcfC, flhD, fliA, fliC, fljB, flgK, and lpfC), and other virulence genes (iroN, pagC, and cigR) were found in each S. Thompson isolate. Additionally, the bacterial inoculation experiment with 1-day-old chicks revealed that clinical S. Thompson was highly pathogenic to newborn chicks after yolk sac inoculation. This study highlighted that the S. Thompson isolated from poultry embryos and the S. Thompson causing human foodborne diarrhea in some parts of China belong to the same cgMLST typology (cgST-12774) and showed the pathogenicity of this clinical S. Thompson to chicks.</td>

      <td>The Resistance Patterns in E. coli Isolates among Apparently Healthy Adults and Local Drivers of Antimicrobial Resistance: A Mixed-Methods Study in a Suburban Area of Nepal</td>
      <td>Evidence-based decision-making to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mandates a well-built community-based surveillance system for assessing resistance patterns among commensals and pathogenic organisms. As there is no such surveillance system in Nepal, we attempted to describe the antimicrobial resistance pattern in E. coli isolated from the fecal samples of apparently healthy individuals in Dhulikhel municipality and also explored the local drivers of AMR. We used a mixed-method design with a cross-sectional quantitative component and a descriptive qualitative component, with focus group discussion and key informant interviews as the data collection method. Fecal samples were collected from 424 individuals randomly selected for the study. E. coli was isolated from 85.9% of human fecal samples, of which 14% were resistant to ≥3 class of antimicrobials (multidrug resistant). Of the 368 isolates, resistance to ampicillin (40.0%), tetracycline (20.7%) and cefotaxime (15.5%) were most prevalent. The major drivers of AMR were: lack of awareness of AMR, weak regulations on sales of antimicrobials, poor adherence to prescribed medications, and incomplete dosage due to financial constraints. These findings indicate the need for strict implementation of a national drug act to limit the over-the-counter sales of antimicrobials. Additionally, awareness campaigns with a multimedia mix are essential for educating people on AMR.</td>

      <td>Determinants of Patients’ Adherence to Malaria Treatment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</td>
      <td>(1) Background: Malaria heavily affects the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) despite the use of effective drugs. Poor adherence to malaria treatment may contribute to this problem. (2) Methods: In one rural and one urban health area in each of the 11 former provinces of the DRC, all households with a case of malaria in the 15 days preceding the survey were selected and the patients or caregivers were interviewed. Adherence to malaria treatment was assessed by self-declaration about its completion. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors. (3) Results: 1732 households participated. Quinine was the most used drug; adherence to artesunate–amodiaquine was the lowest and the main reason for treatment discontinuation was adverse reactions. Predictors of adherence were residence in an urban area, university education, catholic religion, and adoption of recommended behaviour towards a malaria case. Adherence was significantly lower for responders who obtained information on antimalarials from Community Health Workers (CHW). (4) Conclusions: Usage of recommended drugs and adherence to malaria treatment need to be promoted, especially in rural areas, and CHW involvement needs to be improved. Awareness messages need to be made accessible and comprehensible to poorly educated populations and churches need to be involved.</td>

      <td>Prospective study of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis initiation and adherence among young women in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa</td>
      <td>Introduction: Oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), introduced into South Africa (SA) in 2016, has increasingly become part of HIV prevention standard of care. Given the urgent need for increased HIV prevention efforts for young women in SA, we conducted an implementation study to explore oral PrEP initiation and adherence, and the impact of oral PrEP on HIV incidence in this group. Methods: This prospective cohort study (CAPRISA 082) was conducted at two sites (urban and rural) in KwaZulu-Natal, between March 2016 and February 2018. HIV-negative, sexually active women, aged 18–30 years, were enrolled and followed for approximately 10 months. Oral PrEP was offered as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package. Adherence to oral PrEP was measured using pill counts and tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) levels. Characteristics of oral PrEP initiators versus non-initiators were compared using risk ratios. HIV incidence rates were measured using Poisson regression. Results: Of 425 women enrolled, 262 (62%) initiated oral PrEP. Uptake was significantly higher at the rural site compared to the urban site (78% [n = 203/259] vs. 36% [n = 59/166], respectively, p-value&lt;0.001). Approximately 25% and 50% had stopped using oral PrEP by 3 and 12 months post-initiation, respectively. Median pill count adherence was 90% (interquartile range: 81–97%); however, TFV-DP was only detected in 13% of samples tested, that is 56/431 samples from 97 (37%) participants who initiated oral PrEP. In total, 11 women seroconverted yielding an HIV incidence rate of 2.81 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval: 1.40–5.03). Nine of 11 seroconverters had initiated oral PrEP; however, all showed drug levels equivalent to taking one to zero tablets per week. Among women who initiated oral PrEP, &gt;50% had discontinued using oral PrEP by study end, with side effects, such as diarrhoea, nausea, headaches and rash, being the most frequent reason for discontinuation. Conclusions: Despite moderate oral PrEP initiation and high pill count adherence, adherence as measured by TFV-DP levels was low and early discontinuation was high. The overall HIV incidence rate was high underscoring the critical need to address barriers to oral PrEP initiation, adherence and continued use, as well as expanding HIV prevention options for young women.</td>

      <td>HIV drug resistance in a community-randomized trial of universal testing and treatment: HPTN 071 (PopART)</td>
      <td>Introduction: Universal HIV testing and treatment (UTT) has individual and public health benefits. HPTN 071 (PopART), a community-randomized trial in Zambia and South Africa, demonstrated that UTT decreased HIV incidence. This endpoint was assessed in a cohort of &gt;48,000 randomly selected adults in the study communities. We evaluated the impact of UTT on HIV drug resistance in this cohort and compared other resistance-related outcomes in participants with recent versus non-recent HIV infection. Methods: Two years after the start of HPTN 071 (2016–2017), 6259 participants were HIV positive and 1902 were viremic (viral load &gt;400 copies/ml). HIV genotyping and antiretroviral (ARV) drug testing were performed for viremic participants in three groups: seroconverters (infected &lt;1 year), non-seroconverters (infected &gt;1 year, random subset) and participants with unknown duration of infection (random subset). A two-stage cluster-based approach was used to assess the impact of the study intervention on drug resistance. Treatment failure was defined as being viremic with ARV drugs detected. Participants were classified as ARV naïve based on self-report and ARV drug testing. Results: Genotyping results were obtained for 758 participants (143 seroconverters; 534 non-seroconverters; and 81 unknown duration of infection). The estimated prevalence of resistance in the study communities was 37% for all viremic persons and 11% for all HIV-positive persons. There was no association between UTT and drug resistance. Resistance was detected in 14.0% of seroconverters and 40.8% of non-seroconverters (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance: 14.0% and 39.9%; nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance: 0.7% and 15.5%; protease inhibitor resistance: 0% and 1.9%; multi-class resistance: 0.7% and 16.1%, respectively). ARV drugs were detected in 2/139 (1.4%) of seroconverters and 94/534 (17.6%) of non-seroconverters tested. These participants were classified as failing ART; 88 (93.6%) of the non-seroconverters failing ART had resistance. Mutations used for surveillance of transmitted drug resistance were detected in 10.5% of seroconverters and 15.1% of non-seroconverters who were ARV naive. Conclusions: UTT was not associated with an increase in drug resistance in this cohort. Higher rates of drug resistance and multi-class resistance were observed in non-seroconverters compared to seroconverters.</td>

      <td>Transplantation-Associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy Risk Stratification: Is There a Window of Opportunity to Improve Outcomes?</td>
      <td>Transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) can range from a self-limiting condition to a lethal transplantation complication. It is important to identify TA-TMA patients at risk for severe multiorgan endothelial injury to implement targeted therapies in a timely manner. Current therapeutic approaches with complement blockade have improved survival markedly in high-risk TA-TMA patients, yet one-third of these patients respond inadequately to eculizumab therapy. Poor response may indicate that substantial endothelial injury has already occurred and raises the possibility that earlier intervention may improve outcomes. The goal of this study was to identify additional TA-TMA patients who would benefit from early targeted intervention and update TA-TMA risk stratification methods to reflect these findings. We studied 130 HSCT recipients with a diagnosis of TA-TMA who were screened prospectively and stratified into 3 TA-TMA risk groups (high-risk, n = 64; moderate-risk, n = 48; 18 low-risk, n = 18). We specifically examined TA-TMA biomarkers and clinical outcomes in subjects who were not offered complement blocking therapy (moderate-risk and low-risk TA-TMA subjects) and compared them with those who received TA-TMA-targeted therapy (high-risk TA-TMA subjects). One-year post-HSCT survival for subjects with untreated moderate-risk TA-TMA was similar to those with high-risk TA-TMA receiving eculizumab therapy (71% versus 66%; P = .40), indicating that a subset of moderate-risk patients may benefit from therapy. A detailed analysis of moderate-risk subjects highlighted the importance of relative as well as absolute complement pathway activation in determining organ injury. We demonstrated that activated terminal complement (measured by elevated blood sC5b-9) alone is a valuable indicator of reduced survival. Moderate-risk TA-TMA subjects with elevated sC5b-9 levels had a nearly 3-fold higher risk of mortality that was statistically significant in multivariant analyses (P = .01). A “dose effect” also was observed, and higher sC5b-9 levels were associated with worse outcomes. Furthermore, all moderate-risk patients with sustained sC5b-9 elevation for &gt;2 weeks ultimately developed multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This indicates that scheduled sC5b-9 measurements could promptly identify patients at risk for poor outcomes and would facilitate early TA-TMA-directed therapy to prevent organ injury. Untreated low-risk TA-TMA patients had a 1-year post-HSCT survival of 94% and should be observed without targeted interventions. Routine TA-TMA screening and complement-blocking therapies have markedly improved the outcomes for high-risk TA-TMA patients, and our study suggests that additional patients may benefit from TA-TMA treatment. This study provides further support for prospective TA-TMA screening as an integral tool for identifying patients at greatest risk for organ injury and death from TA-TMA. An updated TA-TMA risk algorithm that incorporates relevant laboratory biomarkers, clinical findings, and comorbid conditions was generated using this study's findings, and we propose clinical implementation of this algorithm for the management of TA-TMA.</td>

      <td>Reduced Enterohepatic Recirculation of Mycophenolate and Lower Blood Concentrations Are Associated with the Stool Bacterial Microbiome after Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation</td>
      <td>Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an important immunosuppressant used after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). MMF has a narrow therapeutic index, and blood concentrations of mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active component of MMF, are highly variable. Low MPA concentrations are associated with the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), whereas high concentrations are associated with toxicity. Reasons for variability are not well known and may include the presence of β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, which enhance MPA enterohepatic recirculation (EHR) by transforming MPA metabolites formed in the liver back to MPA. This study was conducted to determine whether individuals with high MPA EHR have a greater abundance of β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in their stool and higher MPA concentrations compared with those with low EHR. We conducted a pharmacomicrobiomics study in 20 adult HCT recipients receiving a myeloablative or reduced-intensity preparative regimen. Participants received MMF 1 g i.v. every 8 hours with tacrolimus. Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling of MMF was conducted before hospital discharge; total MPA, MPA glucuronide (MPAG), and acyl-glucuronide metabolite (acylMPAG) were measured. EHR was defined as the ratio of MPA area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC)(4-8) to MPA AUC(0-8). Differences in stool microbiome diversity and composition, determined by shotgun metagenomic sequencing, were compared above and below the median EHR (22%; range, 5% to 44%). The median EHR was 12% in the low EHR group and 29% in the high EHR group. MPA troughs, MPA AUC(4-8), and acyl-glucuronide metabolite (acylMPAG) AUC(4-8)/AUC(0-8) ratio were greater in the high EHR group compared with the low EHR group (1.53 μg/mL versus .28 μg/mL [P = .0001], 7.33 hour·μg/mL versus 1.79 hour·μg/mL [P = .0003], and .33 hour·μg/mL versus .24 hour·μg/mL [P = .0007], respectively). MPA AUC(0-8) was greater in the high EHR group than in the low EHR group, and the difference trended toward significance (22.8 hour·μg/mL versus 15.3 hour·μg/mL; P = .06). Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides stercoris, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were 1.2- to 2.4-fold more abundant (P = .039, .024, and .046, respectively) in the high EHR group. MPA EHR was positively correlated with B. vulgatus ( = .58; P ≤ .01) and B. thetaiotaomicron ( = .46; P &lt; .05) and negatively correlated with Blautia hydrogenotrophica ( = -.53; P &lt; .05). Therapeutic MPA troughs were achieved in 80% of patients in the high EHR group but in no patients in the low EHR group. There was a trend toward differences in MPA AUC(0-8) and MPA concentration at steady-state (μg/mL) between the high EHR group versus the low EHR group (P = .06). MPA EHR was variable. Patients with high MPA EHR had greater abundance of Bacteroides species in stool and higher MPA exposure compared with patients with low MPA EHR. Therefore, Bacteroides may be protective against poor outcomes, such as graft-versus-host disease, in some patients but may increase the risk of MPA adverse effects in others. These data need to be confirmed and studied after oral MMF therapy.</td>

      <td>Aims This study aimed to investigate the potential of tocilizumab therapy in minimizing mortality and mechanical ventilation (MV) requirements among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods A single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study of 375 patients with severe COVID-19 (from March 1 to April 22, 2020) included 150 patients treated with tocilizumab and 225 consecutive control patients adjusted for age and sex. Both groups received concomitant standard of care treatments in addition to tocilizumab. The statistical methods relied on survival analyses, conditional logistic regression models, and contingency analyses. The outcomes included in-hospital mortality and the MV requirement. Results Tocilizumab associated with improved in-hospital mortality (34.7% vs 46.7%, P = 0.0136) and lower requirement for MV on days 1, 3, and 5 after treatment (P = 0.005, P &lt; 0.0001, and P = 0.0021, respectively). Lower mortality was observed if tocilizumab was administered within 48 hours after admission (P = 0.0226). Older age and low blood oxygen saturation on admission decreased the odds of survival (P &lt; 0.005). Conclusions Our study demonstrates a significant reduction in mortality and decreased requirement of MV with tocilizumab treatment in addition to the standard of care. Early administration of tocilizumab within 48 hours reduces the risk of mortality.</td>

      <td>Background and objectives: Pediatric living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is an effective tool for managing pediatric patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) with good long-term graft and patient survival, especially after improvement in peri-operative care, surgical tools and techniques; however, the morbidity and mortality after such a procedure are still a challenging matter. The study aimed to analyze short-and long-term outcomes after pediatric LDLT in a single centre. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 67 pediatric patients who underwent LDLT in the period from April 2003 to July 2018. The overall male/female ratio was 40/27. Results: Forty-one (61.2%) of patients had ≥1 early and/or late morbidities; the early (less than 3months) and late (≥3months) ones affected 36(53.7%) and 12(17.9%) of them respectively. The 16-year graft and patient survivals were 35(52.2%) while early and late mortalities were 23(34.3%) and 9(13.4%) respectively. Sepsis and chronic rejection were the most frequent causes of early and late mortalities respectively. Moreover, more packed RBCs transfusion units, bacterial infections, and pulmonary complications were independent predictors of poor patient survival. Conclusions: More packed RBCs transfusion units intra-operatively, and post-liver transplant (LT) bacterial infection, sepsis, chronic rejection, as well as pulmonary complications had a negative insult on our patients' outcomes, so proper management of them is mandatory for improving outcomes after pediatric LDLT.</td>

      <td>Background: There is a need for short and safe all-oral treatment of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. We compared outcomes up to 24 months after treatment initiation for patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa treated with a short, all-oral bedaquiline-containing regimen (bedaquiline group), or a short, injectable-containing regimen (injectable group). Methods: Patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, aged 18 years or older, eligible for a short regimen starting treatment between Jan 1 and Dec 31, 2017, with a bedaquiline-containing or WHO recommended injectable-containing treatment regimen of 9–12 months, registered in the drug-resistant tuberculosis database (EDRWeb), and with known age, sex, HIV status, and national identification number were eligible for study inclusion; patients receiving linezolid, carbapenems, terizidone or cycloserine, delamanid, or para-aminosalicylic acid were excluded. Bedaquiline was given at a dose of 400 mg once daily for two weeks followed by 200 mg three times a week for 22 weeks. To compare regimens, patients were exactly matched on HIV and ART status, previous tuberculosis treatment history, and baseline acid-fast bacilli smear and culture result, while propensity score matched on age, sex, province of treatment, and isoniazid-susceptibility status. We did binomial linear regression to estimate adjusted risk differences (aRD) and 95% CIs for 24-month outcomes, which included: treatment success (ie, cure or treatment completion without evidence of recurrence) versus all other outcomes, survival versus death, disease free survival versus survival with treatment failure or recurrence, and loss to follow-up versus all other outcomes. Findings: Overall, 1387 (14%) of 10152 patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis treated during 2017 met inclusion criteria; 688 in the bedaquiline group and 699 in the injectable group. Four patients (1%) had treatment failure or recurrence, 44 (6%) were lost to follow-up, and 162 (24%) died in the bedaquiline group, compared with 17 (2%), 87 (12%), and 199 (28%), respectively, in the injectable group. In adjusted analyses, treatment success was 14% (95% CI 8–20) higher in the bedaquiline group than in the injectable group (70% vs 57%); loss to follow-up was 4% (1–8) lower in the bedaquiline group (6% vs 12%); and disease-free survival was 2% (0–5) higher in the bedaquiline group (99% vs 97%). The bedaquiline group had 8% (4–11) lower risk of mortality during treatment (17·0% vs 22·4%), but there was no difference in mortality post-treatment. Interpretation: Patients in the bedaquiline group experienced significantly higher rates of treatment success at 24 months. This finding supports the use of short bedaquiline-containing regimens in eligible patients. Funding: WHO Global TB Programme.

      <td>When your lungs get cleaned by Harpic: A case report</td>
      <td>Introduction: The use of household cleaning agents as a method of self-harm has been reported in the literature frequently. However, reports of Harpic ingestion a commonly used toilet cleaner is significantly lacking. Due to the ease of access of household cleaning agents, people tend to choose it as quick method of self-harm. The main focus after ingestion of acid is on the digestive tract injury. But due to the tendency to vomit after ingestion of such substance and inhalation of fumes generated there is a high possibility of injury to the respiratory tract as well. Case presentation: Here we present a case of 19-year-old female with injury to the aerodigestive tract presenting with stridor after ingestion of Harpic - a hydrochloriacid-based cleaning solution. In addition to the gastric mucosal injury a diagnosis of chemical pneumonitis was made and her airway was protected in time for her to have a good recovery. Discussion: Inducing vomiting in patients with hydrochloric acid is not advised because it can increase the risk of pulmonary complications as a result of aspiration [8]. Moreover, blind insertion of a nasogastric (Ryle's) tube is not done due to the risk of perforation and induction of regurgitation or vomiting. In few cases steroids have also been tried with no promising results [9]. Since there are no therapeutic standards for caustic injuries, treatment centers on correcting metabolic imbalances, coagulopathy, and emergency surgical intervention for severe injury and late sequelae. However, it is crucial to watch out for aspiration and respiratory tract injury and perform timely protection of the airway. Conclusion: An awareness of the potential impacts of acid ingestion on the respiratory tract with a high level of suspicion towards airway injury and timely protection of airway is crucial for proper management of the patient.</td>

      <td>Introduction: and importance: We reported a case of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) in a 70-years-old male with acute exacerbation of COPD (AE COPD) managed with improvised chest tube drain (ICD). Case presentation: He presented with sudden onset breathlessness and oxygen saturation of 78%. With prolonged expiration on auscultation, he was treated as AE COPD with oxygen therapy, nebulization with albuterol/ipratropium, and injectable antibiotics and steroids. The patient was not improving with treatment on third day, and non-critical respiratory distress continued. Considering the alternative diagnosis, the chest X-ray was done which revealed right sided spontaneous pneumothorax and COPD. Due to his reluctancy to go to higher center for chest tube insertion during ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we inserted ICD (intravenous set put in saline bottle) at our primary care. Following drainage, breathlessness improved and saturation increased. Then inpatient symptomatic treatment for COPD was continued for three more days. He was discharged on inhalers after fifth day and asked for follow up after 10 days. He came after 1 month and on repeat chest X-ray, his right sided pneumothorax resolved completely and COPD was in control with inhaled medications. There was no recurrence of pneumothorax in five months follow up. Clinical discussion: ICD is a safe, and an alternative option in resource limited setting. However, the guidelines recommend chest tube insertion as appropriate treatment. Conclusion: This would remind the physicians to anticipate the alternative possibility, and to re-examine those with AE COPD who are not improving as expected with oxygen and nebulization therapy.</td>

      <td>Effects of antipsychotics on triglyceride trajectories and its implications in CVD: A longitudinal cohort study</td>
      <td>Background: Although the association between short-term antipsychotics exposure and triglycerides (TG) levels has been confirmed, the effects of long-term antipsychotics exposure on TG trajectories and its implications in cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains largely unknown. Methods: A total of 39,988 participants with at least 3 TG measurements between January 2014 and February 2021 were included in this longitudinal study, with a median follow-up was 4.48 years. A latent class growth mixed model (LCGMM) was used to identify TG trajectories. Based on the LCGMM parameters, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) and estimated the effect of antipsychotics on AUC and TG trajectory slopes. The primary outcome was CVD events. We also investigated and compared the association between antipsychotics and CVD in subgroups stratified by TG trajectory and TG levels. Findings: A total of 11,543 CVD events were documented and the incidence density was 64.64 per 1000 person-years. We identified two TG trajectories labeled as inverse-U shape (30.77%, n=12306) and low-decreasing (69.23%, n=27682). The antipsychotic exposure increased total AUC by 13% and increased the slopes of TG trajectories before age 48 years. In the inverse-U and low-decreasing group, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for antipsychotics associated with CVD were 1.40 (1.21-1.62) and 1.29 (1.14-1.45), respectively, and the difference between the two trajectory groups become larger with the increase of the antipsychotic exposure. The association of antipsychotics with CVD (HR=1.72, 95%CI: 1.36-2.19) in inverse-U trajectory and high TG group was stronger than that in other subgroups. Interpretation: Long-term antipsychotic exposure increased the TG burden and TG increase rate early in life. The strength of the association between antipsychotics and CVD risk in the inverse-U group was stronger than that in the low-decreasing group.

      <td>Sleep problems in pain patients entering tertiary pain care: The role of pain-related anxiety, medication use, self-reported diseases, and sleep disorders</td>
      <td>Chronic pain and sleep problems frequently co-occur. Pain itself disturbs sleep, but other factors may also contribute to sleep problems in pain patients. This cross-sectional study of 473 patients (69.9% female, mean age 47 years) entering tertiary pain management compared normally sleeping pain patients with those having recurring sleep problems to determine the relationship between pain and sleep. Groups were compared for pain and pain aetiology, pain-related anxiety, childhood adversities, use of sleep and pain medications, self-reported diseases, and sleep disorders. Furthermore, the association of pain-related anxiety (cognitive anxiety, escape/avoidance, fear, and physiological anxiety) with more disturbing sleep problems was investigated in the whole cohort. The main results were that those with sleep problems more often reported multiple health conditions than those sleeping normally (depression 31.6% vs 5.0%; angina pectoris 6.5% vs 0.0%; asthma 19.6% vs 1.7%; low back problems 55.1% vs 23.3%; joint disease other than rheumatoid arthritis 32.3% vs 18.3%). Accumulations of 5 or more childhood adversities were more often present in those with sleep problems. Restless legs symptoms were more common in those with sleep problems than those sleeping normally (33.2% vs 11.7%). Patients having sleep problems reported more use of sleep and pain medications than those sleeping normally. Findings about pain-related anxiety suggest physiological reactions as significant factors for increased sleep disturbances. These factors need to be addressed in the management of the comorbidity of pain and sleep problems, and research to understand mechanisms in these is sorely needed.</td>

      <td>Evolving patterns of antiretroviral drug interactions in people with HIV in British Columbia, Canada</td>
      <td>Objectives: To characterize the annual prevalence of antiretroviral/nonantiretroviral drug interactions in relation to antiretroviral therapy (ART)-prescribing patterns, and to describe drug interaction-related ART changes. Design/methods: This cohort study included ART-treated adults in British Columbia, Canada between 01 January 2010 and 31 December 2016. Medication dispensing records were abstracted from a population-based, linked administrative-health dataset and used to identify antiretroviral-comedication drug interactions (’caution’/’avoid’ drug interactions in HIV-focused drug interaction checkers). We identified temporal trends in annual drug interaction prevalence and quantified the association between taking higher drug interaction-risk ART and receiving nonrecommended antiretroviral-comedication combinations using Poisson regression models, modified for binary outcomes and correlated data. Clinician-reported, drug interaction-related ART changes and associated adverse events were abstracted from an HIV drug treatment registry and summarized descriptively. Results: Among 8571 ART-treated adults who received nonantiretroviral comedications, prevalence of having any drug interaction or receiving nonrecommended drug combination(s) significantly declined from 85 to 71% and 5.6 to 3.2%, respectively, between 2010 and 2016 (P &lt; 0.001). This paralleled a shift from higher drug interaction-risk ART (e.g. ritonavir/cobicistat-boosted protease inhibitors) to lower drug interaction-risk ART (e.g. unboosted integrase inhibitors). Risk of receiving a nonrecommended antiretroviral-comedication combination was greater for persons taking higher vs. lower drug interaction-risk ART [adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 3.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.24 – 4.35]. Boosted antiretroviral-inhaled corticosteroid drug interactions accounted for the most commonly dispensed, nonrecommended drug combinations, and the most commonly reported drug interaction-related adverse events (adrenal insufficiency). Conclusion: The prevalence of antiretroviral-comedication drug interactions is declining as ART shifts towards antiretrovirals with lower drug interaction potential but nonrecommended drug combinations remain a concern. Healthcare providers should screen for drug interactions whenever drugs are prescribed or dispensed.</td>

      <td>Skin and Soft Tissue Infection Treatment and Prevention Practices by Pediatric Emergency Medicine Providers</td>
      <td>Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) treatment and prevention practices among pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) clinicians in the context of current clinical practice guidelines and contemporary evidence. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey of PEM clinicians belonging to the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Emergency Medicine Survey listserv. Four varying hypothetical clinical scenarios of children with SSTI were posed to respondents; subsequent items assessed SSTI treatment and prevention practices. Provider demographics were collected. Results: Of 160 survey respondents, more than half stated that they would prescribe oral antibiotics for each clinical scenario, particularly for more complex presentations (small uncomplicated abscess, 51.8%; large uncomplicated abscess, 71.5%; recurrent abscess, 83.5%; febrile abscess, 90.3%; P &lt; 0.001). Most commonly selected antibiotics were clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Across scenarios, more than 80% selected a duration of treatment 7 days or more. Of the 121 respondents who prescribe preventive measures, 85.1% recommend hygiene measures; 52.5% would prescribe decolonization with topical antibiotic ointment and 77.5% would recommend antiseptic body washes. Half of the respondents reported that their institution has standard guidance for SSTI management. Conclusions: Although current evidence supports adjuvant antibiotics for all drained SSTI and decolonization for the index patient and household contacts, PEM clinicians do not consistently adhere to these recommendations. In light of these findings, development and implementation of institutional guidelines are necessary to aid PEM clinicians' point-of-care decision making and improving evidence-based practice.</td>

      <td>Quantitative Proteomics Reveals That the Protein Components of Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) in Aeromonas hydrophila Play Protective Roles in Antibiotic Resistance</td>
      <td>In recent years, the intracellular mechanisms that contribute to antibiotic resistance have received increasing attention, and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) have been reported to be related to antibiotic resistance in several Gram-negative bacterial species. However, the intrinsic molecular mechanisms and the form of such antibiotic resistance are still largely unknown. In this study, OMVs from an oxytetracycline (OXY) sensitive aquatic pathogen, Aeromonas hydrophila (OXY-S), were found with significantly increased OXY resistance. Interestingly, the OXY-resistant strain (OXY-R) had a more protective role in OXY resistance. Therefore, a DIA-based quantitative proteomics analysis was performed to compare the differential expression of OMV proteins between OXY-R (OMVs(R)) and OXY-S (OMVs(S)). The results showed that seven proteins increased and five proteins decreased in OMVs(R)vs OMVs(S). A subsequent antibiotics susceptibility assay showed that the deletion of icd, rpsF, and iscS significantly increased OXY sensitivity. Moreover, the exogenous addition of the crude OMV fractions of overexpressed recombinant proteins in E. coli with rRpsF, rIcd, rIscS, rOmpA, rPepA, rFrdA, and rRplQ demonstrated that these proteins promoted the OXY resistance of A. hydrophila. Overall, our results indicate the important protective role of OMVs in antibiotic resistance in A. hydrophila and provide novel insights on bacterial antibiotic resistance mechanisms. 2022 American Chemical Society.</td>

      <td>Optimal Doses of Specific Antipsychotics for Relapse Prevention in a Nationwide Cohort of Patients with Schizophrenia</td>
      <td>Background and Hypothesis: Optimal doses of most antipsychotics in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia are unknown. We aimed to study the risk of severe relapse indicated by rehospitalization for different dose categories of 15 most frequently used antipsychotics in monotherapy in Finland. Study Methods: We studied the risk of rehospitalization (Adjusted Hazard Ratio, aHR) associated with six antipsychotic monotherapy dose categories (as time-varying dose, measured in defined daily dose, DDDs/day) in a nationwide cohort of persons diagnosed with schizophrenia (n = 61 889), using within-individual analyses to eliminate selection bias. Study Results: Among the 15 most widely used antipsychotics, 13 had a U- or J-shaped dose-response curve, showing the lowest risks of relapse for doses of 0.6-&lt;1.1 DDDs/day vs nonuse of antipsychotics. The exceptions were oral perphenazine (aHR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.68-0.76, &lt;0.6 DDDs/day), and olanzapine-long-acting injectable (LAI), which had the lowest aHR of any antipsychotic (aHR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.11-0.25, 1.4-&lt;1.6 DDDs/day). Certain risperidone and perphenazine doses &lt;0.9 DDD/day were associated with 21%-45% lower risk of rehospitalization (P &lt;. 001) than the standard dose of 0.9-1.1 DDD/day (ie, 5 mg for risperidone and 30 mg for perphenazine). Conclusions: For most antipsychotics, the risk of severe relapse was the lowest during use of standard dose. Our results suggest that olanzapine LAI is highly effective in dose ranges &gt;0.9 DDD/day, and especially at 1.4-&lt;1.6 DDDs/day (405 mg/4 weeks) associated with substantially lower risk of rehospitalization than any dose of any other antipsychotic. The current WHO standard dose definitions appear to be clearly too high for perphenazine and somewhat too high for risperidone.</td>

      <td>Background and Hypothesis: Antipsychotics remain the main treatment for schizophrenia, but their effectiveness is challenging to compare. We aimed to assess the comparative real-world effectiveness of antipsychotics in preventing readmission among patients in Asia with early-stage schizophrenia to inform clinical decision making. Study Design: We did a retrospective cohort study of first-admission schizophrenia patients (ICD-9-CM: 295; ICD-10-CM: F20 and F25) from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017. The cohort was identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database NHIRD for Psychiatric Inpatients. The exposure was any antipsychotics prescribed post-discharge. The primary outcome was the readmission risk due to psychotic disorders, which was measured by adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). Within-individual extended Cox models were applied for analyses, where the periods of oral risperidone use served as his or her own control. Study Results: We selected 75 986 patients (men, 53.4%; mean [SD] age, 37.6 [12.0] years; mean [SD] duration of follow-up, 8.9 [5.0]) who were first admitted to psychiatric wards with schizophrenia in Taiwan. Among them, 47 150 patients (62.05%) had at least one readmission within 4 years. Compared to the period under treatment with oral risperidone, that under monotherapy with long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) had the lowest risk for psychotic readmission, with a risk reduction of 15-20%. However, the prevalence of person-prescription prevalence of LAIs remained low (&lt; 10%) during the follow-up period. Conclusions: The use of LAIs after the first admission for schizophrenia has notable advantages in preventing readmission. Such formulations should be offered earlier in the course of illness.</td>

      <td>Dimensions of Formal Thought Disorder and Their Relation to Gray- and White Matter Brain Structure in Affective and Psychotic Disorders</td>
      <td>Factorial dimensions and neurobiological underpinnings of formal thought disorders (FTD) have been extensively investigated in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). However, FTD are also highly prevalent in other disorders. Still, there is a lack of knowledge about transdiagnostic, structural brain correlates of FTD. In N = 1071 patients suffering from DSM-IV major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or SSD, we calculated a psychopathological factor model of FTD based on the SAPS and SANS scales. We tested the association of FTD dimensions with 3 T MRI measured gray matter volume (GMV) and white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) using regression and interaction models in SPM12. We performed post hoc confirmatory analyses in diagnostically equally distributed, age- and sex-matched sub-samples to test whether results were driven by diagnostic categories. Cross-validation (explorative and confirmatory) factor analyses revealed three psychopathological FTD factors: disorganization, emptiness, and incoherence. Disorganization was negatively correlated with a GMV cluster comprising parts of the middle occipital and angular gyri and positively with FA in the right posterior cingulum bundle and inferior longitudinal fascicle. Emptiness was negatively associated with left hippocampus and thalamus GMV. Incoherence was negatively associated with FA in bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, and positively with the hippocampal part of the right cingulum bundle. None of the gray or white matter associations interacted with diagnosis. Our results provide a refined mapping of cross-disorder FTD phenotype dimensions. For the first time, we demonstrated that their neuroanatomical signatures are associated with language-related gray and white matter structures independent of diagnosis.</td>

      <td>Background and Hypothesis: Hallucinations may be driven by an excessive influence of prior expectations on current experience. Initial work has supported that contention and implicated the anterior insula in the weighting of prior beliefs. Study Design: Here we induce hallucinated tones by associating tones with the presentation of a visual cue. We find that people with schizophrenia who hear voices are more prone to the effect and using computational modeling we show they overweight their prior beliefs. In the same participants, we also measured glutamate levels in anterior insula, anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, and auditory cortices, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Study Results: We found a negative relationship between prior-overweighting and glutamate levels in the insula that was not present for any of the other voxels or parameters. Conclusions: Through computational psychiatry, we bridge a pathophysiological theory of psychosis (glutamate hypofunction) with a cognitive model of hallucinations (prior-overweighting) with implications for the development of new treatments for hallucinations.</td>

Herein, we present a case of advanced gastric cancer with intramural abscess, which was successfully treated with curative gastrectomy. Case Report: A 77-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for dull epigastric pain with inflammatory findings and diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer (cT4aN1M0 Stage III) with intramural abscess. Since an endoscopic ultrasonography-guided abscess drainage was not effective, after conservative therapy with antibiotics, she underwent distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy and fortunately the tumor with abscess was safely and curatively removed without perforation. Microscopically, the 82×65 mm tumor invaded the subserosa and contained tubular adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine cell carcinoma (pT3N0M0 Stage IIB), and the abscess formed from the ulcerative lesion of the cancer extended to the subserosa. The postoperative clinical course was uneventful, and she remained disease-free during the 22 months follow-up. Conclusion: Given the nature of the disease and the difficulty in endoscopic treatment, gastrectomy should be performed immediately for advanced gastric cancer with GWA to ensure control of both gastric cancer and infection.</td>

      <td>Background: Real-Time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is an affordable method to quantify antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) targets, allowing comparisons of ARG abundance along animal production chains. Objectives: We present a comparison of ARG abundance across various animal species, production environments and humans in Europe. AMR variation sources were quantified. The correlation of ARG abundance between qPCR data and previously published metagenomic data was assessed. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in nine European countries, comprising 9572 samples. qPCR was used to quantify abundance of ARGs [aph(3′)-III, erm(B), sul2, tet(W)] and 16S rRNA. Variance component analysis was conducted to explore AMR variation sources. Spearman's rank correlation of ARG abundance values was evaluated between pooled qPCR data and earlier published pooled metagenomic data. Results: ARG abundance varied strongly among animal species, environments and humans. This variation was dominated by between-farm variation (pigs) or within-farm variation (broilers, veal calves and turkeys). A decrease in ARG abundance along pig and broiler production chains ('farm to fork') was observed. ARG abundance was higher in farmers than in slaughterhouse workers, and lowest in control subjects. ARG abundance showed a high correlation (Spearman's ρ&gt;0.7) between qPCR data and metagenomic data of pooled samples. Conclusions: qPCR analysis is a valuable tool to assess ARG abundance in a large collection of livestock-Associated samples. The between-country and between-farm variation of ARG abundance could partially be explained by antimicrobial use and farm biosecurity levels. ARG abundance in human faeces was related to livestock antimicrobial resistance exposure.</td>

      <td>Autoimmune systemic diseases (ASD) show impaired immunogenicity to COVID-19 vaccines. Our prospective observational multicenter study aimed at evaluating the seroconversion elicited by COVID-19 vaccine over the entire vaccination cycle including the booster dose. Among 478 unselected ASD patients originally evaluated at the end of the first vaccination cycle (time 1), 344 individuals were re-evaluated after a 6-month period (time 2), and 244 after the booster vaccine dose (time 3). The immunogenicity of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) was assessed by measuring serum IgG-neutralizing antibody (NAb) on samples obtained at the three time points in both patients and 502 age-matched controls. In the 244 ASD group that received booster vaccine and monitored over the entire follow-up, the mean serum NAb levels (time 1, 2, and 3: 696.8 ± 52.68, 370.8 ± 41.92, and 1527 ± 74.16SD BAU/mL, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001) were constantly lower compared to controls (p &lt; 0.0001), but they significantly increased after the booster dose compared to the first two measurements (p &lt; 0.0001). The percentage of patients with absent/suboptimal response to vaccine significantly decreased after the booster dose compared to the first and second evaluations (time 1, 2, and 3: from 28.2% to 46.3%, and to 7.8%, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001). Of note, the percentage of patients with absent/suboptimal response after the booster dose was significantly higher compared to controls (19/244, 7.8% vs 1/502, 0.2%; p &lt; 0.0001). Similarly, treatment with immune-modifiers increased the percentage of patients exhibiting absent/suboptimal response (16/122, 13.1% vs 3/122, 2.46%; p = 0.0031). Overall, the above findings indicate the usefulness of booster vaccine administration in ASD patients. Moreover, the persistence of a significantly higher percentage of individuals without effective seroconversion (7.8%), even after the booster dose, warrants for careful monitoring of NAb levels in all ASD patients to identify those with increased risk of infection. In this particularly frail patients’ setting, tailored vaccination and/or therapeutic strategy are highly advisable.</td>

In this paper, we described a case of COVID-19 with rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis. Methods: The nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) from a nasopharyngeal sample for SARS-CoV-2 was done. Demographic data, biochemical tests, paranasal sinuses (PNS) CT scan, brain CT scan, chest CT scan, and palate biopsy were performed. Results: The NAAT was positive for SARS-CoV-2. PNS CT scan revealed mucosal thickening of all paranasal sinuses, brain CT scan showed hypodense area in antero-inferior cortex, and chest CT scan revealed diffuse ground glass opacity in favor of COVID-19 infection. Palate biopsy revealed fibroconnective tissue with broad pauciseptated ribbon-like hyphae. Conclusions: In this paper, a case of COVID-19 with rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis was described. The treatment with immunosuppressive drugs predisposed this patient to secondary fungal infection.

To achieve this aim, lymphocytes were isolated using Ficoll paque plus. The results showed that risperidone (12, 24 and 48 nM) causes toxicity in human blood lymphocytes by increasing the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), damage to lysosomal membrane, the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and increased extracellular oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Also, exposure of human blood lymphocytes to risperidone is associated with a decrease in intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels. Finally, it could be concluded that oxidative stress is one of the mechanisms of risperidone-induced toxicity in human blood lymphocytes.</td>

      <td>Role of corneal biopsy in the management of infectious keratitis</td>
      <td>Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to review the existing literature and investigate the role of microbiologic culture and histopathologic examination of corneal biopsies in the management of infectious keratitis.Recent findingsCorneal biopsy continues to be a significantly useful tool in the diagnosis and tailored management of infectious keratitis. Several techniques can be employed for tissue collection, handling and processing to optimize diagnostic yield and maximize safety, including emerging femtosecond laser-assisted biopsy.SummaryCorneal opacities represent a significant cause of global blindness, and infectious keratitis is the most common cause. Organism identification in progressive infectious keratitis is essential for proper management. However, microbiological culture alone has a high rate of false-negative results. Records from the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute were retrospectively searched for patients between 1 January 2015, and 31 December 2019, who underwent corneal biopsy, therapeutic keratoplasty or endothelial graft removal for infectious keratitis and had specimens bisected and submitted for evaluation with both microbiologic culture and histopathologic examination. Detection of bacteria, fungus and mycobacteria was not statistically different between culture and histopathology. Microbiology and histopathology are complementary methods for the identification of causative microorganisms in corneal specimens with presumed infectious keratitis.</td>

      <td>Akathisia among Patients Undergoing Antipsychotic Therapy: Prevalence, Associated Factors, and Psychiatric Impact</td>
      <td>Objectives The prevalence of akathisia is variably reported in the literature and its psychiatric impact is little studied. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence, the associated factors, and the psychiatric impact of akathisia among patients undergoing antipsychotic treatment. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out at the Department of Psychiatry A, at Razi Hospital, in Tunis. It included patients with psychosis, undergoing antipsychotic treatment, from June 2016 to February 2017. Akathisia was diagnosed according to the Barnes Akathisia Scale. Results The prevalence of akathisia was 19.5% (n = 24, schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, n = 20; bipolar disorder, n = 4). The delay between the diagnosis of the disease and the onset of akathisia was 7.1 ± 8.8 years. Among the sample of patients with akathisia, 20/24 were on monotherapy of which 14 on conventional antipsychotics and six on atypical antipsychotics. Patients with akathisia were on atypical (8/24), low-potency conventional (4/24), or high-potency conventional (17/24) antipsychotics. The average dose of antipsychotics in chlorpromazine equivalent was 2294.5 ± 3037.7 mg. After adjusting for confounders, the only factor significantly positively associated with the diagnosis of akathisia was the dose of antipsychotics prescribed (P = 0.01). The following psychiatric manifestations were reported by patients with akathisia: dysphoria/irritability (16/23), anxiety (18/24), sadness (15/24), suicidal thoughts (11/24), heteroaggressivity (8/23), sleep disturbances (16/24), and suicidal attempts (9/24). Conclusions Despite the high psychiatric and social burden of akathisia, it remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated, because in part of its subjective component.</td>

      <td>Probable Miglustat-Induced Psychosis in a Child with Niemann-Pick Type C</td>
      <td>Background Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal disease in which psychiatric symptoms, such as psychosis, can also be observed. Miglustat is indicated in cases with progressive neurological manifestations, and although there have been studies reporting that miglustat completely cures psychosis, it has been recently observed that miglustat may also trigger psychosis. We report on a rare case of probable miglustat-induced psychosis in a patient with NP-C. Case A 21-year-old female patient presented with a complaint of social isolation that started at the age of 6 years. During clinical follow-up, the patient's clinical progress deteriorated, and ocular apraxia, ataxia, seizures, and dementia developed at the age of 15 years. A genetic investigation was performed, and a homozygous p.P120S (c.358C &gt; T) variant was detected in the NPC2 gene. Miglustat was initiated at the age of 15 years, and during the 6 months of treatment, psychotic symptoms such as unwarranted anger, suspiciousness, and delusions developed. Consequently, the miglustat was discontinued by the parents of the patient, and the psychosis completely disappeared. The patient has experienced no further psychotic episodes in the approximately 5.5 years following the discontinuation of therapy. Conclusion Although a positive effect of miglustat on neurological and psychiatric symptoms has been reported, there exists a risk of psychosis being triggered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of pediatric NP-C to develop psychosis after miglustat to be reported in literature. Further studies of such cases are needed to understand the impact of miglustat on psychiatric symptoms in NP-C.</td>

      <td>Background: To compare the corneal biomechanical changes after small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and femtosecond laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) with the same programmed optical zone (POZ) and similar refractive correction in patients with high myopia. Methods: In this prospective comparative study of the contralateral eye, 50 patients with high myopia with the same POZ and similar refractive correction who underwent SMILE in one eye and FS-LASIK in the other eye. Corneal biomechanical parameters and central corneal thickness (CCT) were measured using a Corvis ST II. All the patients were evaluated during follow-up visits beyond one year. Additionally, the corneal volume (CV) of the 10-mm diameter region was measured using a Pentacam. Results: Ambrosio relational thickness to the horizontal profile (ARTh) and stiffness parameter A1 (SP-A1) decreased significantly after SMILE and FS-LASIK, whereas deformation amplitude ratio 2.0 mm (DA ratio 2.0 mm) and integrated radius (IR) increased significantly in both groups. The ARTh and SP-A1 were greater after SMILE than those after FS-LASIK at all the follow-up visits. In addition, there were greater amounts of CCT and CV after SMILE compared with that after FS-LASIK. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between ARTh and SP-A1 and postoperative CCT, while a negative correlation was found between IR and DA ratio 2.0 mm and postoperative CCT. A moderate correlation was observed between SP-A1 and CV after both SMILE and FS-LASIK, whereas there were no relationships between CV and ARTh, IR, or DA ratio 2.0 mm. Conclusions: SMILE had greater CCT, CV, ARTh, and SP-A1 than FS-LASIK in high myopia with the same POZ and similar refractive correction. Our results demonstrated that SMILE had lesser effect on corneal biomechanics than FS-LASIK in high myopia.</td>

      <td>Salmonella Central Carbon Metabolism Enhances Bactericidal Killing by Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics</td>
      <td>The efficacy of killing by bactericidal antibiotics has been reported to depend in large part on the ATP levels, with low levels of ATP leading to increased persistence after antibiotic challenge. Here, we show that an atp operon deletion strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium lacking the ATP synthase was at least 10-fold more sensitive to killing by the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin and yet showed either increased survival or no significant difference compared with the wild-type strain when challenged with aminoglycoside or b-lactam antibiotics, respectively. The increased cell killing and reduced bacterial survival (persistence) after fluoroquinolone challenge were found to involve metabolic compensation for the loss of the ATP synthase through central carbon metabolism reactions and increased NAD (P)H levels. We conclude that the intracellular ATP levels per se do not correlate with bactericidal antibiotic persistence to fluoroquinolone killing; rather, the central carbon metabolic pathways active at the time of challenge and the intracellular target of the antibiotic determine the efficacy of treatment.</td>

      <td>Introduction Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) brought a heavy healthcare burden worldwide. Macrolide maintenance therapy was proved to be helpful in reducing exacerbation of NCFB. However, the optimal dosing regimens of macrolides have not been determined, and its efficacy in Chinese NCFB population has not been validated. This protocol describes a head-to-head clinical trial designed to compare the efficacy of two dosing regimens of azithromycin in Chinese NCFB population. Methods and analysis This prospective, open-label and randomised controlled trial will be conducted in the First People's Hospital of Jiashan, China. Eligible patients with high-resolution CT defined NCFB will be randomly divided into three groups, which will receive either 250 mg daily azithromycin, or 500 mg three-times-weekly azithromycin or no treatment for 6 months. They will be followed up for another 6 months without treatment. The primary outcome is the mean rate of protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbation at 6 months.

      <td>Objectives Current guidelines for the control of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) recommend deworming children and other high-risk groups, primarily using school-based deworming (SBD) programmes. However, targeting individuals of all ages through community-wide mass drug administration (cMDA) may interrupt STH transmission in some settings. We compared the costs of cMDA to SBD to inform decision-making about future updates to STH policy. Design We conducted activity-based microcosting of cMDA and SBD for 2 years in Benin, India and Malawi within an ongoing cMDA trial. Setting Field sites and collaborating research institutions. Primary and secondary outcomes We calculated total financial and opportunity costs and costs per treatment administered (unit costs in 2019 USD ($)) from the service provider perspective, including costs related to community drug distributors and other volunteers. Results On average, cMDA unit costs were more expensive than SBD in India ($1.17 vs $0.72) and Malawi ($2.26 vs $1.69), and comparable in Benin ($2.45 vs $2.47). cMDA was more expensive than SBD in part because most costs (∼60%) were € supportive costs' needed to deliver treatment with high coverage, such as additional supervision and electronic data capture. A smaller fraction of cMDA costs (∼30%) was routine expenditures (eg, drug distributor allowances). The remaining cMDA costs (∼10%) were opportunity costs of staff and volunteer time. A larger percentage of SBD costs was opportunity costs for teachers and other government staff (between ∼25% and 75%). Unit costs varied over time and were sensitive to the number of treatments administered. Conclusions cMDA was generally more expensive than SBD. Accounting for local staff time (volunteers, teachers, health workers) in community programmes is important and drives higher cost estimates than commonly recognised in the literature. Costs may be lower outside of a trial setting, given a reduction in supportive costs used to drive higher treatment coverage and economies of scale. Trial registration number NCT03014167.</td>

      <td>Introduction Blackwater fever (BWF), a complication of malaria, has in the past been considered as a rare complication of malaria in children living in high transmission settings. More recently, however, a growing number of paediatric clusters of BWF cases have been reported predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The aim of this study is to map evidence on BWF among children in SSA from 1 January 1960 to 31 December 2021. Methods and analysis This review will be guided by Arksey and O' Malley's methodological framework for scoping reviews with methodological refinements by Levac et al and will comply with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews' guidelines. Five electronic databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO) will be systematically searched using predefined keywords. In addition, reference lists of included articles will be searched. Our multidisciplinary team has formulated search strategies and two reviewers will independently complete study eligibility screening, final selection and data extraction. A third reviewer will adjudicate the final decision on disputed articles. Bibliographic data and abstract content will be collected and analysed using a data-charting tool developed iteratively by the research team. Ethics and dissemination This scoping review being a secondary analysis does not require ethics approval. We anticipate results of this review will broaden understanding of paediatric BWF in SSA and identify its research gaps in SSA. We will be disseminating results through journals and conferences targeting primary care providers.</td>

      <td>Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is resistant to the β-lactam antibiotics due to a non-classical transpeptidase in the cell wall with β-lactamase activity. A recent study showed that meropenem combined with clavulanate, a β-lactamase inhibitor, was effective in multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB). However, in Korea, clavulanate can only be used as drugs containing amoxicillin. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility and genetic mutations of drug-resistant Mtb isolates to amoxicillin-clavulanate and meropenem-clavulanate to improve the diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant TB patients. Methods: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of amoxicillin-clavulanate and meropenem-clavulanate was examined by resazurin microtiter assay. We used 82 MDR and 40 XDR strains isolated in Korea and two reference laboratory strains. Mutations of drug targets blaC, blaI, ldtA, ldtB, dacB2, and crfA were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Results: The MIC(90) values of amoxicillin/clavulanate and meropenem/clavulanate in drug-resistant Mtb isolates were 64/2.5 and 16/2.5 mg/L, respectively. Gene mutations related to amoxicillin/clavulanate and meropenem/clavulanate resistance could not be identified, but T448G mutation was found in the blaC gene related to β-lactam antibiotics’ high susceptibility. Conclusion: Our results provide clinical consideration of β-lactams in treating drug-resistant TB and potential molecular markers of amoxicillin-clavulanate and meropenem-clavulanate susceptibility.</td>

      <td>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the serious bacterial infections that cause diseases and may lead to death. In this study, 178 individuals were examined for TB infection at Baghdad TB center during the period from 15(th) January to 1(st) October 2021. Out of 178 participants, 73 were shown to be positive for TB infection, while 105 showed negative results. According to the results, there was no significant variation between infected males and females with TB in comparison to the control group (P&gt;0.05). The results showed that the mean age of the patients for both males and females was in the range of 2-65 years. Additionally, there were significant differences in patients with TB compared to the control group in terms of the weight loss of 8.82 ± 6.75 Kg, red blood cell (RBC) count (3.43 ± 0.56) × 10(6)/μl, white blood cell (WBC) count (3.12 ± 1.57) × 10(6)/μl, platelet count (1.03 ± 0.56) × 10(6)/μl, and hemoglobin level (6.66 ± 1.34) g/dl. A total of 30 TB patients and 50 normal individuals were genotyped to detect the IL-1β rs 114534 gene. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for exon amplification in region 5 of the ILB1 gene in the TB patients by using specific primers. The finding showed that there was an amplified product of 249bp located in chromosome 2q13-14. A total of 30 TB patients and 50 normal individuals were also genotyped to detect the IL-6 rs 1800795 gene. The PCR was used for amplification of the IL-6 gene in TB patients by using specific primers. The finding showed that there was an amplified product of 431 bp located in chromosome 7p15-p2. The expression of the ILB1 gene was investigated in TB patients and healthy controls by using qPT-PCR. Results showed that there was a high Ct value for patients and controls with a high Ct value of templates, preoperational to the total ribonucleic acid (RNA) concentration and gene expression. The expression of the IL-6 gene was investigated in TB patients and healthy controls by using qPT-PCR. Our findings revealed a high Ct value for patients and controls with a high Ct value of templates, preoperational to the total RNA concentration and gene expression.</td>

      <td>Antibiotic resistance is an important public health problem. One potential solution is the development of synergistic antibiotic combinations, in which the combination is more effective than the component drugs. However, experimental progress in this direction is severely limited by the number of samples required to exhaustively test for synergy, which grows exponentially with the number of drugs combined. We introduce a new metric for antibiotic synergy, motivated by the popular Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index and the Highest Single Agent model. We also propose a new experimental design that samples along all appropriately normalized diagonals in concentration space, and prove that this design identifies all synergies among a set of drugs while only sampling a small fraction of the possible combinations. We applied our method to screen two- through eight-way combinations of eight antibiotics at 10 concentrations each, which requires sampling only 2,560 unique combinations of antibiotic concentrations.</td>

      <td>Sinusoidal Uptake Determines the Hepatic Clearance of Pevonedistat (TAK-924) as Explained by Extended Clearance Model</td>
      <td>Quantitative assessment of hepatic clearance (CL(H)) of drugs is critical to accurately predict human dose and drug-drug interaction (DDI) liabilities. This is challenging for drugs that involve complex transporter-enzyme interplay. In this study, we demonstrate this interplay in the CL(H) and DDI effect in the presence of CYP3A4 perpetrator for pevonedistat using both the conventional clearance model (CCM) and the extended clearance model (ECM). In vitro metabolism and hepatocyte uptake data showed that pevonedistat is actively transported into the liver via multiple uptake transporters and metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 (88%). The active uptake clearance (CL(act,inf)) and passive diffusion clearance (CL(diff,inf)) were 21 and 8.7 ml/min/kg, respectively. The CL(act,inf) was underpredicted as Empirical Scaling Factor of 13 was needed to recover the in vivo plasma clearance (CL(plasma)). Both CCM and ECM predicted CL(plasma) of pevonedistat reasonably well (predicted CL(plasma) of 30.8 (CCM) and 32.1 (ECM) versus observed CL(plasma) of 32.2 ml/min/kg). However, both systemic and liver exposures in the presence of itraconazole were well predicted by ECM but not by CCM (predicted pevonedistat plasma area under the concentration-time curve ratio (AUCR) 2.73 (CCM) and 1.23 (ECM))., The ECM prediction is in accordance with the observed clinical DDI data (observed plasma AUCR of 1.14) that showed CYP3A4 inhibition did not alter pevonedistat exposure systemically, although ECM predicted liver AUCR of 2.85. Collectively, these data indicated that the hepatic uptake is the rate-determining step in the CL(H) of pevonedistat and are consistent with the lack of systemic clinical DDI with itraconazole. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In this study, we successfully demonstrated that the hepatic uptake is the rate-determining step in the CL(H) of pevonedistat. Both the conventional and extended clearance models predict CL(plasma) of pevonedistat well however, only the ECM accurately predicted DDI effect in the presence of itraconazole, thus providing further evidence for the lack of DDI with CYP3A4 perpetrators for drugs that involve complex transporter-enzyme interplay as there are currently not many examples in the literature except prototypical OATP substrate drugs.</td>

      <td>Evaluation of mass treatment with ivermectin program reach and survey coverage for onchocerciasis elimination in selected endemic areas of Ethiopia</td>
      <td>Currently, national governments of onchocerciasis endemic African countries are working towards the elimination of the disease using mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin as a primary strategy. Attainment of this goal requires implementation of prolonged high MDA coverage in all endemic areas, and vigilant monitoring and evaluation of the program. This study was thus conducted with the purpose of i) providing estimate of ivermectin coverage, ii) validating the MDA coverage reported through community drug distributors (CDDs), iii) determining the factors associated with MDA coverage, and iv) estimating the difference between MDA program reach and survey coverage rates following MDA campaign carried out in May 2017 in Asosa and Yeki districts in Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 2,824 study participants in Asosa and Yeki districts. A total of 50 kebeles (smallest administrative units) were randomly selected from the two districts. A systematic sampling was employed to select study households from the 50 kebeles. Then, a household member was randomly selected for the interview. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to determine the odds ratio and to observe the associations between the MDA survey coverage and the variables used. Eighty-seven percent (2458/2824) of the respondents from both districts responded that they were offered ivermectin during the May 2017 MDA campaign. At the district level, 1182 individuals from Yeki and 1276 from Asosa, received the drug, that indicate 88.5% and 85.8% MDA program reach in Yeki and Assosa districts, respectively. Whereas, a total of 366 individuals were not offered ivermectin in both study districts. Of these, 47(12.8%), 143(39.1%), and 176(48.1%) did not receive the drug because of program implementation-related reasons, ineligibility criteria, and personal issues, respectively. Of the 1488 and 1336 respondents in Asosa and Yeki, 1272 and 1182 participants took the drug, resulting in survey coverage rate of 85.5% (95% CI: 83.6-87.2%) and 88.5% (95% CI: 86.7-90.1%), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed significantly low survey coverage rate in females (AOR = 0.5, 95%CI: 0.3-0.6; p&lt;0.001) and in those whose age ranges between 15-24 years (AOR = 0.5, 95%CI: 0.3-0.8; p = 0.007) and 25-34 years (AOR = 0.5, 95%CI: 0.3-0.9; p = 0.021) in Asosa. The researchers believe that the current study generated operational evidence on MDA program reach and coverage rates in two study districts in Ethiopia. The survey coverages were lower than the recommended 90% minimum threshold for success. Only Yeki district reached the 90% threshold survey coverage. Both districts had reported higher coverages than the survey estimates (even outside the 95% CI), thus, were not validated. The majority (60.9%) of the reasons for not receiving the drug were related to program implementation and recipients'personal issues. Efforts must therefore be directed to enhance MDA coverage in future rounds via proper MDA planning and implementation, such as allocating adequate time to the MDA activities, health education, and mobilizing of all segments of the population, including adolescents and the youth. The researchers also recommend such studies to be extended to other MDA programs for other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).</td>

      <td>We aimed to determine the role of serum cytokine expression in invasive aspergillosis (IA) diagnosis and outcome prediction in hematologic patients. In this multicenter study, serum cytokines (IL6, IL10, INF-gamma, IL12, IL4, TNF-alpha, IL17, and IL23) were prospectively recruited from all consecutive patients with hematologic malignances at IA diagnosis and compared to control patients matched by center, age, baseline disease, and therapeutic regimen. We included 36 patients with IA and 36 controls. Serum levels of IL6 and IL10 cytokines on day 0 were significantly increased in patients with IA when compared to controls (P = 0.001 and P = 0.025, respectively), even in those who were neutropenic. No differences were observed for the other cytokines. IL6 and IL10 predicted IA with an area under the ROC curve of 0.74 (95% CI 0.62-0.86) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.51-0.77), respectively. The best cutoff point in predicting IA was 20.85 pg/ml for IL6 (sensitivity 72.2%; specificity 77.8%; PPV 76.5% and NPV 73.7%), and 0.045 pg/ml for IL10 (sensitivity 62.9%; specificity 63.9%; PPV 62.9% and NPV 63.9%). IL6 levels were associated with increased mortality, with the best cutoff value being 65.59 pg/ml in mortality prediction. In conclusion, in addition to current tests in place, IL6 and IL10 levels - as measured in plasma - may help clinicians diagnose IA. High levels of IL6 at IA diagnosis are related with worse outcomes. Lay summary: We evaluated the role of serum cytokine expression in invasive aspergillosis (IA) diagnosis and outcome. Serum levels of IL6 and IL10 are increased in patients with IA compared to controls, and IL6 levels are associated with mortality.</td>

Whilst patients more frequently present with acute heart failure, diagnosis is difficult due to heterogeneity in clinical presentations. Case summary: This case report presents a previously healthy 59-year-old Vietnamese woman who initially presented with syncope and a motor vehicle accident who developed rapid decline in left ventricular function. Her initial echocardiogram was suggestive of an infiltrative cardiomyopathy. GCM was confirmed on biopsy, and she received combined immunosuppression. Twenty-seven days following her initial presentation to hospital, she was unable to recover from severe multi-organ dysfunction, and the patient was palliated and passed away. Discussion: This case highlights the varied manner in which GCM may present. Even in the absence of cardiogenic shock at presentation, giant cell myocarditis should be considered in the evaluation of new cardiomyopathy of uncertainty aetiology.

      <td>Background: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa where it is the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality in the young. Rheumatic heart disease results from recurrent episodes of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), which are often difficult to diagnose clinically. Acute rheumatic fever may be diagnosed based on the revised Jones Criteria 2015 for the diagnosis of ARF. Histologically, acute rheumatic valvulitis manifests with active inflammation characterized by lymphocytic infiltration, Aschoff bodies, and Anitschkow cells. Chronic rheumatic valvulitis is associated with neovascularization, and/or dystrophic calcification. The combination of histological features of both ARF and chronic RHD is a rare finding. Case summary: Here we report on a case of a 59-year-old woman with mixed aortic and mitral valve disease of probable rheumatic aetiology (elevated C-reactive protein and prolonged PR interval) and with histological evidence of lymphocytic infiltration, Aschoff bodies, and fibrinoid necrosis admixed with features of chronic RHD. Discussion: Cases of chronic RHD admixed with ARF are very rare; however, they should be considered in regions with a high prevalence of RHDs.</td>

      <td>Background and objectives Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes wide range of nosocomial and community-acquired infections which have spread worldwide leading to an urgent need for developing effective anti-staphylococcal agents. Efflux is an important resistance mechanism that bacteria used to fight the antimicrobial action. This study aimed to investigate the efflux mechanism in S. aureus and assess diclofenac, domperidone, glyceryl trinitrate and metformin as potential efflux pump inhibitors that can be used in combination with antibiotics for treating topical infections caused by S. aureus. Materials and methods Efflux was detected qualitatively by the ethidium bromide Cart-Wheel method followed by investigating the presence of efflux genes by polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-six isolates were selected for further investigation of efflux by Cart-Wheel method in absence and presence of tested compounds followed by quantitative efflux assay. Furthermore, antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations in absence and presence of tested compounds were determined. The effects of tested drugs on expression levels of efflux genes norA, fexA and tetK were determined by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction. Results Efflux was found in 65.3% of isolates, the prevalence of norA, tetK, fexA and msrA genes were 91.7%, 77.8%, 27.8% and 6.9%. Efflux assay revealed that tested drugs had potential efflux inhibitory activities, reduced the antibiotic's MICs and significantly decreased the relative expression of efflux genes. Conclusion Diclofenac sodium, domperidone and glyceryl trinitrate showed higher efflux inhibitory activities than verapamil and metformin. To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows that diclofenac sodium, glyceryl trinitrate and domperidone have efflux pump inhibitory activities against S. aureus.</td>

      <td>Background The increasing rate of antimicrobial-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae poses a considerable public health threat due to the difficulty in treating gonococcal infections. This study examined antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to drugs recommended for gonorrhea treatment between 2015 and 2017, and the AMR determinants and genetic compositions of plasmids in 3 gonococcal strains with high-level penicillin resistance. Methods We collected 117 N. gonorrhoeae isolates from patients with gonococcal infections who attended Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between 2015 and 2017. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, spectinomycin, cefixime, and ceftriaxone were determined by the agar dilution method. PCR amplification and sequencing of 23S rRNA and mtrR (a negative regulator of MtrCDE efflux pump) were performed. Whole genomes of 3 PPNG strains with high-level penicillin resistance (MIC ≥ 128 μg/ml) were sequenced using Illumina and Nanopore sequencing platforms. Results The proportions of N. gonorrhoeae isolates with resistance were 84.6% for penicillin, 91.5% for tetracycline, and 96.6% for ciprofloxacin. All isolates were susceptible to spectinomycin, azithromycin, cefixime, and ceftriaxone. An adenine deletion within a 13 bp inverted repeat sequence in the mtrR promoter and an H105Y mutation in the mtrR coding region were found in the N. gonorrhoeae isolate with the highest azithromycin MIC value (1 μg/ml). Three high-level penicillin-resistant isolates contained nonmosaic type II penA and had mutations in penB and the mtrR coding region. All isolates with high-level penicillin resistance carried the conjugative plasmids with or without the Dutch type tetM determinant, the beta-lactamase plasmid (Rio/Toronto), and the cryptic plasmid. Conclusions The gonococcal population in Thailand showed high susceptibility to ceftriaxone and azithromycin, current dual therapy recommended for gonorrhea treatment. As elevated MIC of azithromycin has been observed in 1 strain of N. gonorrhoeae, expanded and enhanced surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility and study of genetic resistance determinants are essential to improve treatment guidelines.</td>

      <td>Genetic editing of multi-resistance plasmids in Escherichia coli isolated from meat during transfer</td>
      <td>Resistance plasmids mediate the rapid spread of antimicrobial resistance, which poses a threat to veterinary and human healthcare. This study addresses the question whether resistance plasmids from Escherichia coli isolated from foodstuffs always transfer unchanged to recipient E. coli cells, or that genetic editing can occur. Strains containing between one and five different plasmids were co-incubated with a standard recipient strain. Plasmids isolated from transconjugant strains were sequenced using short and long read technologies and compared to the original plasmids from the donor strains. After one hour of co-incubation only a single plasmid was transferred from donor to recipient strains. If the donor possessed several plasmids, longer co-incubation resulted in multiple plasmids being transferred. Transferred plasmids showed mutations, mostly in mobile genetic elements, in the conjugative transfer gene pilV and in genes involved in plasmid maintenance. In one transconjugant, a resistance cluster encoding tetracycline resistance was acquired by the IncI1 plasmid from the IncX1 plasmid that was also present in the donor strain, but that was not transferred. A single plasmid transferred twelve times back and forth between E. coli strains resulted in a fully conserved plasmid with no mutations, apart from repetitive rearrangements of pilV from and back to its original conformation in the donor strain. The overall outcome suggests that some genetic mutations and rearrangements can occur during plasmid transfer. The possibility of such mutations should be taken into consideration in epidemiological research aimed at attribution of resistance to specific sources.</td>

      <td>Background: Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) often require treatment with high-dose systemic steroids (SS) and other immunosuppressive agents (ISAs). NCCN Guidelines recommend prophylactic antibiotics for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) for patients receiving prolonged SS/ISAs. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the incidence of opportunistic infections (OIs) and non-OIs and the role of prophylactic antibiotics in patients on SS/ISAs for irAEs. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients treated using immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy at 5 MedStar Health hospitals from January 2011 to April 2018. OIs were defined per the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the prevention and treatment of OIs in patients with HIV. The study cohort included patients who received ≥20 mg daily of a prednisone equivalent for ≥4 weeks to manage irAEs. Results: The study cohort identified 112 (15%) of 758 total patients treated using ICIs. Baseline characteristics included the following: median age was 64 years, 74% (n=82) of patients were White, 89% (n=100) had an ECOG performance status #1, 61% (n=68) had melanoma, 19% (n=21) had non–small cell lung cancer, 45% (n=50) were treated using an anti–PD-(L)1 ICI, and 33% (n=37) were treated using an anti–PD-1/anti–CTLA-4 combination. The median starting SS dose was 100 mg of a prednisone equivalent, and 25% of patients required additional ISAs, with infliximab (n=15) and mycophenolate mofetil (n=9) being the most common. We found that 20% (n=22) of patients developed any infection, including 7% (n=8) with OIs (oral candidiasis [n=4], nondisseminated varicella zoster infection [n=2], PJP [n=1], and Listeria monocytogenes endophthalmitis [n=1]) and 13% (n=14) with non-OIs (most common: Clostridium difficile and pneumonia [n=5 each]). PJP prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was given to 13% (n=14) patients, of whom 43% (n=6) developed OIs/non-OIs. Conclusions: Our study highlights the fundamental issues for patients on ICI therapy who require SS/ISAs for irAEs: the degree of immunosuppression and the relative risk of OI. We noted a low incidence of OIs overall and breakthrough infections despite PJP prophylaxis. We question whether PJP prophylaxis is efficacious or necessary. Prospective trials are required to answer these questions.</td>

      <td>Background: Crowdfunding is increasingly used to offset the financial burdens of illness and health care. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated infodemic, the role of crowdfunding to support controversial COVID-19 stances is unknown. Objective: We sought to examine COVID-19-related crowdfunding focusing on the funding of alternative treatments not endorsed by major medical entities, including campaigns with an explicit antivaccine, antimask, or antihealth care stances. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of GoFundMe campaigns for individuals requesting donations for COVID-19 relief. Campaigns were identified by key word and manual review to categorize campaigns into "Traditional treatments," "Alternative treatments," "Business-related," "Mandate," "First Response," and "General." For each campaign, we extracted basic narrative, engagement, and financial variables. Among those that were manually reviewed, the additional variables of "mandate type," "mandate stance," and presence of COVID-19 misinformation within the campaign narrative were also included. COVID-19 misinformation was defined as "false or misleading statements," where cited evidence could be provided to refute the claim. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study cohort. Results: A total of 30,368 campaigns met the criteria for final analysis. After manual review, we identified 53 campaigns (0.17%) seeking funding for alternative medical treatment for COVID-19, including popularized treatments such as ivermectin (n=14, 26%), hydroxychloroquine (n=6, 11%), and vitamin D (n=4, 7.5%). Moreover, 23 (43%) of the 53 campaigns seeking support for alternative treatments contained COVID-19 misinformation. There were 80 campaigns that opposed mandating masks or vaccination, 48 (60%) of which contained COVID-19 misinformation. Alternative treatment campaigns had a lower median amount raised (US $1135) compared to traditional (US $2828) treatments (P&lt;.001) and a lower median percentile of target achieved (11.9% vs 31.1%; P=.003). Campaigns for alternative treatments raised substantially lower amounts (US $115,000 vs US $52,715,000, respectively) and lower proportions of fundraising goals (2.1% vs 12.5%) for alternative versus conventional campaigns. The median goal for campaigns was significantly higher (US $25,000 vs US $10,000) for campaigns opposing mask or vaccine mandates relative to those in support of upholding mandates (P=.04). Campaigns seeking funding to lift mandates on health care workers reached US $622 (0.15%) out of a US $410,000 goal. Conclusions: A small minority of web-based crowdfunding campaigns for COVID-19 were directed at unproven COVID-19 treatments and support for campaigns aimed against masking or vaccine mandates. Approximately half (71/133, 53%) of these campaigns contained verifiably false or misleading information and had limited fundraising success.</td>

      <td>Aggressive Pituitary Adenoma Not Fulfilling the New High-Risk Criteria with Progression after 18-Year Stable Clinical Course: Case Report</td>
      <td>Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the endocrine organs was revised in 2017. The term atypical adenoma is no longer recommended, and tumors with rapid growth, radiologic invasion, and high K i-67 labeling index are defined as high-risk adenomas. In this article, we present the case of an aggressive pituitary adenoma not fulfilling the new high-risk criteria with extraordinary rapid progression after very long stable disease, and discuss the remaining problem of the new criteria in terms of a complicated balance between pathologic findings and clinical features. Case Description: A 67-year-old man was admitted with sellar tumor. Serum prolactin concentration was high at 4,552.2 ng/mL. Transsphenoidal surgery achieved subtotal removal. Histologic diagnosis was lactotroph cell adenoma, and K i-67 labeling index was 2.6%. Postoperatively, magnetic resonance imaging revealed no evidence of tumor regrowth, but terguride or cabergoline administration was continued for slight hyperprolactinemia. Second surgery was performed 18 years after initial surgery because the tumor showed extraordinary rapid regrowth and hyperprolactinemia of 969 ng/mL. Histologic diagnosis was lactotroph cell adenoma with K i-67 labeling index of 28.9% and positive immunoreactivity for p53. This case could be diagnosed as a high-risk adenoma from the beginning of treatment based on the WHO 2017 criteria, but the clinical course was unusually long and the indication of aggressive adjuvant therapy after initial surgery remained unsolved. Conclusion: Pathologic confirmation for the present definition would be expected to assess the cutoff between typical adenomas and aggressive tumors.</td>

Kinetics and isotherm data are well fitted to the pseudo-second-order rate model and Langmuir model, respectively. Adsorption experiments and characterizations reveal that the adsorption mechanism involved in TCH and MG adsorption on BLPC mainly depends on the synergistic effect of pore filling, H-bonding, π-π interactions and weak electrostatic interactions. In addition, BLPC shows excellent photothermal properties, and the adsorption capacity of TCH and MG on BLPC can reach 584 and 847 mg/g under the irradiation of near infrared lamp for 50 min, respectively. The synthesized BLPC with high adsorption efficiency, good recovery ability, improved adsorption under near-infrared irradiation can be a promising and effective adsorbent for TCH or MG or other pollutes.</td>

      <td>Alveolar osteitis associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis</td>
      <td>A critical point in dentistry is the empiric prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics that could increase the levels of antimicrobial resistance. Alveolar osteitis is one of the most common post-op- erative complications in which antibiotic use is controversial. A 35-year-old female, with pain in the right mandibular region and treated with cefixime, was diagnosed with cracked tooth syndrome and pulpitis. The tooth was extracted and a massive purulent bleeding drainage was observed. Irrigation of the socket and a new therapy with azithromycin were done. Bacteriological analysis, a specific mecA gene PCR for the methicillin resistance, and the antimicrobial susceptibility test were per- formed on the bacterial isolate. A Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate was methicillin-resistant and showed resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and sulfamethoxazole + trimeth- oprim. After 7 days, intraoral examination showed a complete resolution. The aim of this report is to suggest that systemic antibiotics may provide insufficient efficacy during alveolar osteitis, especially when caused by a multidrug-resistant organism.</td>

      <td>The Outcome of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation From Different Donors in Recipients With Mucopolysaccharidosis</td>
      <td>There is limited information regarding hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IV and VI. This study examined the full donor chimerism, specific lysosomal enzyme levels, and the survival of different MPS children after HSCT from various donor sources and compared the prognosis. A total of 42 children with MPS underwent HSCT, 9 cases were type I, 14 were type II, 15 were type IV, and 4 were type VI. A total of 24 patients received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and 18 patients received umbilical cord blood (UCB). Patients who received PBSC were conditioned with intravenous (IV) busulfan every 6 h for a total of 16 doses, IV cyclophosphamide (CY, 200 mg/kg), and antihuman thymocyte globulin (ATG, 10 mg/kg). While conditioning regimen of patients who received UCB was adjusted to ATG (preposed, pre-) + busulfan + fludarabine + Cy, which includes IV ATG (pre-, 6 mg/kg), IV busulfan every 6 h for a total of 16 doses, IV fludarabine (200 mg/m(2)) and CY (200 mg/kg). Also, 95.2% (40 of 42) of patients achieved full donor chimerism, and all patients’ specific lysosomal enzyme levels reached normal. The estimated overall survival (OS) at 1 year was 92.9%. There was no significant difference in 1-year OS between patients who received PBSC transplantation and those who received UCB grafts (87.5% vs. 100%, p = 0.0247). The incidence of acute and chronic GVHD did not differ between them. The incidences of pneumonia in PBSC recipients and UCB recipients were 45.8 and 33.3%, respectively, but there few patients suffering from respiratory failure (4.2 and 5.6%, respectively) due to pneumonia. The incidence of cytomegaloviremia was also high in both groups, 58.3 and 44.4% respectively, However, no patient developed CMV disease. All deaths (3 of 42) occurred in patients receiving PBSC grafts, and there was no death in patients receiving UCB grafts. There was no death after transplantation in patients with MPS IV and VI. In addition, respiratory and nervous system functions were improved, whereas valvular heart disease was improved in some patients but progressed in more patients after transplantation. In summary, HSCT is a good therapeutic option for MPS, not only for patients with MPS I or II but also for those with MPS IV or VI. The specific lysosomal enzyme levels can be completely restored to normal, which is the basis for patients to resolve a broad range of clinical outcomes. Moreover, UCB with suitable HLA (HLA-match above 7/10 and 4/6) is a suitable donor source for MPS. Patients who underwent UCB transplantation using the conditioning regimen ATG (pre-) + busulfan + fludarabine + Cy can achieve a higher proportion of full donor chimerism and survival with less severe complications. HSCT can improve organs function in patients with MPS, but it is still worth exploring.</td>

      <td>Intramedullary spinal cord abscess associated with right-to-left shunt via right superior vena cava draining into left atrium: A case report</td>
      <td>Rationale: Intramedullary spinal cord abscess (ISCA) is a rare but treatable bacterial infection of the central nervous system, and the etiology in no less than 40% of the cases is cryptogenic. Although a few cases of ISCA in individuals with a right-to-left shunt (RL shunt) have been reported, only few arguments focused on the association between RL shunt and ISCA have been provoked. The right superior vena cava (RSVC) draining into the left atrium (LA) is an uncommon systemic venous anomaly that results in an RL shunt, and this anomaly causes several types of neurological complication such as stroke or brain abscess. We report the first case of ISCA associated with RSVC-LA RL shunt. Patient concerns: A 36-year-old man developed progressive paraparesis, dysuria, and spontaneous pain in the lumbar region and lower extremities. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intramedullary lesion extended from Th12 to L2 with ring-shaped gadolinium enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study exhibited a marked pleocytosis, and CSF culture grew Streptococcus intermedius. Cardiovascular computed tomography angiography identified RSVC-LA RL shunt, which caused transient acute cardiac syndrome due to air embolus. Diagnoses: The patient was diagnosed with ISCA associated with an RSVC-LA RL shunt. Interventions: The patient was treated with a combination of intravenous administration of meropenem and vancomycin in a daily dose of 6 and 2.5 g, respectively, followed by intravenous administration of ampicillin in a daily dose of 750 mg. The intravenous antibiotic therapy was continued for 37 days. Outcomes: A favorable neurological outcome was obtained by the intravenous antibiotic therapy, and recurrence of infection was prevented by continuous oral antibiotic therapy for 18 months. Lessons: With a literature review of ISCA associated with RL shunt, we insist that screening for RSVC-LA is beneficial to patients who are diagnosed with cryptogenic ISCA as its identification leads to appropriate preventive therapy.</td>

      <td>Background: This study aimed to report a case who was treated with corticosteroids and anti- parasitic agents for ocular toxoplasmosis, but who progressed to acute retinal necrosis, and finally retinal detachment. Case Presentation: A 42-year-old man presented to the ophthalmology clinic with a 1-month history of progressive blurred vision and floaters in his right eye. His best visual acuity (VA) was 20/20 in both eyes. The anterior segment was unremarkable. Funduscopic examination of the right eye revealed active lesions of whitish foci of chorioretinitis with surrounding edema along the superonasal vessels, and retinal vasculitis with perivascular sheathing. Serologic testing was positive for Toxoplasma gondii IgM and IgG, but negative for other virus- and syphilis infections. Ocular toxoplasmosis was diagnosed. Corticosteroids and anti-parasitic agents were given simultaneously, but his right eye VA became 20/100. Funduscopic examination revealed retinal necrosis with localized retinal breaks. We immediately performed focal photocoagulation, however, his right eye progressed to retinal detachment and required vitrectomy. Conclusion: Early administration of systemic corticosteroids in patients with acquired acute ocular toxoplasmosis may lead to complications that impair vision. Intensive observation should be arranged after corticosteroid use.</td>

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common among type of infection among outpatients, with a lifetime incidence of about 60-65% in adult females. Here, we sought to isolate uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPCE) from urine specimens and investigates the prevalence of clb A, B and cnf 1, 2 genes among these isolates. A total of 110 E. coli isolates were collected from patients with UTIs. All the isolates were examined for their hemolytic activity and only 46 isolates showed a halo zone of hemolysis on blood agar. The collected UPEC isolates were screened for the existence of clb A, B and cnf genes. The results revealed that out of 110 isolates, 28 harbored the clbA gene, 40 harbored clb B, and 24 isolates harboured cnf1. 13 isolates harbored clbA, clbB, and cnf1 genes, while no cnf2 gene was detected among isolates. The molecular detection revealed that 8 out of 28 hemolytic isolates carrying the clbA, 11 out of 40 were carrying clbB, 1 out of 24 were carrying cnf 1, and 5 out of 9 carrying clbA+clbB. Furthermore, 7 out of 13 isolates were hemolytic and carrying clbA, clbB, and cnf1 genes. Finally, we investigated the cytotoxicity of E. coli harboring clb and cnf genes, eukaryotic REF cells were exposed to E. coli producing colibactin, which induces DNA damage and leads to cell cycle arrest, senescence and death.</td>

      <td>Understanding distribution of bovine mastitis pathogen Klebsiella spp. can contribute to the treatment decision and the control within programs of bovine mastitis, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance rates of Klebsiella spp. associated with bovine mastitis in China. Three databases, namely, PubMed, Google scholar, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, were utilized to obtain relevant publications. According to PRISMA reporting standards, a total of 38 publications were included in the research, among them, 7 papers included an AMR test. The pooled prevalence of Klebsiella spp. was 5.41% (95% CI: 3.87–7.50%). Subgroup analysis revealed that the prevalence was higher in South China (8.55%, 95% CI: 3.57–19.09%) than in North China (4.22%, 95% CI: 2.46–7.14%), in 2010–2020 (7.45%, 95% CI: 5.29–110.40%) than in 2000–2010 (3.14%, 95% CI: 1.90–15.14%), and in the clinical bovine mastitis cases (7.49%, 95% CI: 3.71–14.54%) than in the subclinical cases (4.03%, 95% CI: 1.55–10.08%). The pooled AMR rate revealed that Klebsiella spp. were most resistant to sulfonamides (45.07%, 95% CI: 27.72–63.71%), followed by tetracyclines (36.18%, 95% CI: 23.36–51.34%), aminoglycosides (27.47%, 95% CI: 17.16–40.92%), β-lactams (27.35%, 95% CI: 16.90–41.05%), amphenicol (26.82%, 95% CI: 14.17–44.87%), lincosamides (21.24%, 95% CI: 7.65–46.75%), macrolides (20.98%, 95% CI: 7.20–47.58%), polypeptides (15.51%, 95% CI: 6.46–32.78%), and quinolones (7.8%, 95% CI: 3.25–17.56%). The climate difference between South and North China and the natural pathogenicity of Klebsiella spp. may be the primary reasons for its distribution, and the prevalence of Klebsiella spp. indicated that the genus is an increasing hazard to the dairy industry. The prevalence of AMR in China is commonly higher than in the European countries and Canada, this is a very important concern for strategy programs to control bovine mastitis caused by Klebsiella spp. in China.</td>

      <td>Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by infection, with high incidence and mortality. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out an effective anti-infection treatment. In this work, we designed and synthesized red blood cell (RBC) membrane-coated PLGA nanoparticles named γ3-RBCNPs, which target the highly expressed intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) at the site of infection through the γ3 peptide on its surface and kill the Klebsiella pneumoniae through ciprofloxacin encapsulated in its core. In addition, the homogenous RBC membrane coated on the surface of the nanoparticles helps them avoid immune surveillance and prolong the circulation time of the drug in the body. We found that the γ3-RBCNPs target human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) activated by TNF-α in vitro and the infected lung of mice in the sepsis model very well. In vitro evaluation suggested that γ3-RBCNPs have a low risk of acute hemolysis and are less likely to be engulfed by macrophages. In vivo evaluation showed that γ3-RBCNPs has a long half-life and good bio-safety. More importantly, we confirmed that γ3-RBCNPs have the good antibacterial and anti-infection ability in vivo and in vitro. Our research provides a new strategy for the nano-drug treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced sepsis.</td>

      <td>Immediate-release tofacitinib reduces insulin resistance in non-diabetic active rheumatoid arthritis patients: A single-center retrospective study</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND An increased risk of insulin resistance (IR) has been identified in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory disorder with elevated levels of pathogenic cytokines. Biologics targeting proinflammatory cytokines can control the disease and improve insulin sensitivity in RA. Although Janus kinase (JAK) signaling can regulate cytokine receptors and participate in RA pathogenesis, it remains to be elucidated whether there is a reduction of IR in such patients under JAK inhibitor (JAKi) therapy. AIM To study the effect of JAKi treatment on the reduction of IR in RA patients with active disease. METHODS A retrospective study was carried out from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2021 in a population of non-diabetic patients with active RA who were undergoing tofacitinib (TOF) therapy with 5 mg twice-daily immediate-release formulation. RESULTS Fifty-six RA patients, aged 30 years to 75 years (mean ± SD: 52.3 ± 11.1) with disease activity score 28 values ranging from 4.54 to 7.37 (5.82 ± 0.74), were classified into high-IR (&gt; 2.0) and low-IR (≤ 2.0) groups based on their baseline homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR levels. They had no previous exposure to JAKi, and received TOF therapy for no less than 6 mo. In 30 patients who were naïve to biologics, after a 24-week therapeutic period, the high-IR group showed reduced HOMA-IR levels (3.331 ± 1.036 vs 2.292 ± 0.707, P &lt; 0.001). In another 26 patients who were exposed to tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-6 blockers, the high-IR group, despite having achieved a decrease but with lower magnitude than in naïve patients, showed reduced HOMA-IR levels (2.924 ± 0.790 vs 2.545 ± 1.080, P = 0.018). CONCLUSION In this retrospective study, reduced IR was achieved in non-diabetic active RA patients following 24 wk of TOF therapy.</td>

The diagnosis of dementia was based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) to identify. Based on the 2019 AGS Beers criteria, the PIM prescriptions were evaluated. The identification of potential factors was completed using a binary logistic regression model. Results: Of 18,624 older outpatients with dementia, 3.52% were detected with 1 PIM, and 35.91% received at least two PIMs. The antipsychotic drugs quetiapine and olanzapine were most frequently prescribed in patients with PIM, accounting for 8.01 and 7.36%, respectively. Logistic regression analyses showed that female patients with dementia aged &gt;80 years who took more medications were exposed easily to PIM use. Conclusion: PIM use among older outpatients with dementia in China is highly prevalent, and the associated risk factors were increasing age, female sex, and number of medications. The most frequently prescribed drugs by clinicians were anpsychotropic drugs, which were much more frequent than other drugs.</td>

      <td>Background: Discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment is a common problem in patients with schizophrenia and could reduce the effectiveness of treatment. Time to discontinuation (TTD) is one of the indicators of compliance and may also be an effective indicator of medication efficacy. The aim of the study was to compare the clinical effectiveness of quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole in the real-world treatment of schizophrenia with 3-years follow-up. Method: A multi-center, open, cohort, prospective, real-world study was conducted. 706 patients were analyzed without intervention in medication selection and use, followed up for 3 years. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to draw the treatment discontinuation rates (TDR) curves at each time point. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to assess the relative risk of TTD of antipsychotics. Results: There was a significant difference among monotherapy groups in all-cause antipsychotic treatment discontinuation (p = 0.0057). Among the four medications, the TDR of risperidone was the highest. Compared with polypharmacy, except for aripiprazole, the TDR of other three monotherapy medications were lower than that of polypharmacy, and olanzapine was statistically different (p = 0.0325). The cox regression analysis showed that after correction of Hochberg with multiple tests, only olanzapine had a relative risk lower than risperidone (p &lt; 0.0083). Conclusions: The findings indicated that risperidone monotherapy and polypharmacy had the highest TDR and the shortest TTD. Olanzapine monotherapy had a relative risk lower than risperidone and was superior to polypharmacy.</td>

Star-RD inhibited P-gp activity, potently sensitizing both low- and high-P-gp-expressing cancer cells to the cytostatic and proapoptotic activity of Dox in vitro. Star-RD + Dox possessed higher cytostatic and proapoptotic activities compared to Star-Dox and the equivalent mixture of Star-Dox and Star-RD in vitro. Star-RD + Dox efficiently inhibited STAT3 signaling and induced caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation in cancer cells in vivo. Importantly, Star-RD + Dox was found to have superior antitumor activity in terms of tumor growth inhibition and increased survival of mice bearing P-gp-expressing tumors.</td>

      <td>Drug self-delivery nanorods enhance photodynamic therapy of triple-negative breast cancer by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation</td>
      <td>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows very high potential for the clinical treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. However, the efficacy of PDT is significantly weakened by tumor hypoxia, the relatively high intracellular glutathione levels and the active proliferation of cancer cells. To address these issues, we developed a novel drug self-delivery nanorod (defined as AINRs) through the hydrophobic interaction among the mitochondrial complex III inhibitor (atovaquone, ATO), the photosensitizer (indocyanine green, ICG) and the dispersion stabilizer (distearoyl phosphoethanolamine-polyethylene glycol 2000, DSPE-PEG 2000). The AINRs showed a rod-like morphology with a mean diameter of 120.6 ± 5.4 nm, a zeta potential of −26.35 ± 1.63 mV and a significantly high drug loading rate of 93.48%. The results of in vitro cell experiments involving triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (4T1 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells) indicated that the AINRs could effectively block the oxidative phosphorylation of cancer cells through the inhibition of mitochondrial complex III, which results in the reduction of endogenous oxygen consumption and the decrease of the intracellular ATP level. The reduction of ATP content further inhibited the glutathione synthesis and arrested the cell cycle at the S-phase, which results in enhanced in vitro PDT efficacy of ICG. The results of in vivo antitumor activity in 4T1-bearing mice showed that the tumor growth inhibition rate of the AINRs with near-infrared laser irradiation (NIR) was greater than 90%, whereas the tumor growth inhibition rates of the AINRs without NIR, ICG with NIR and doxorubicin (3 mg/kg) were only 31.68%, 61.15% and 24.59%, respectively. In addition, the results of safety studies, including body weights, biochemical indicators and H&amp;E staining images of the main organs demonstrated the security of the AINRs. In summary, this study showed that the oxidative phosphorylation inhibition of triple-negative breast cancer was a safe and effective method to enhance its PDT efficacy.</td>

      <td>Emerging Antibiotic Resistance Patterns in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in Pune, India: A 2-Year Retrospective Study</td>
      <td>Objective: Treating neonatal bloodstream infections and meningitis in South Asia remains difficult given high rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To evaluate changing epidemiology of neonatal infections, we assessed pathogen-specific and clinical features of culture-proven infections in neonates admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Pune, India. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study was performed in the King Edward Memorial Hospital and Research Center NICU over 2 years between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018. We included all neonates admitted to the NICU with positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid cultures. Demographic, clinical, and microbiologic data were collected from the medical record. We reviewed antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of all isolates. Results: There were 93 culture-positive infections in 83 neonates, including 11 cases of meningitis. Fifteen (18%) neonates died. Gram-negative pathogens predominated (85%) and AST showed 74% resistance to aminoglycosides, 95% resistance to third/fourth generation cephalosporins, and 56% resistance to carbapenems. Resistance to colistin was present in 30% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Birth weight &lt;1,000 g [odds ratio (OR) 6.0, p &lt; 0.002], invasive respiratory support (OR 7.7, p = 0.001), and antibiotics at the time of culture (OR 4.2, p = 0.019) were associated with increased risk of mortality. Rates of AMR to all major antibiotic classes were similar between early onset and late onset infections. There was no association between carbapenem resistance and mortality. Conclusion: In our NICU in India, there are high rates of AMR among Gram-negative pathogens that are predominantly responsible for infections. Given higher colistin resistance in this cohort than previously reported, hospitals should consider routinely testing for colistin resistance.</td>

      <td>Objectives: We evaluated the prevalence and risk factors for hepatic steatosis in South African children with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) who started treatment early and remain on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to HIV-uninfected children. Design: A cross-sectional study from April 2019 to October 2021. PHIV, HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) and HIV-unexposed (HU) children were enrolled from an ongoing cohort study. Methods: All children had transient elastography (TE) with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Liver enzymes, lipogram, insulin and glucose were sent after an overnight fast. Multivariable linear regression analyses identified predictors of CAP. Hepatic steatosis was defined as CAP&gt;248kPa. Results: 215 children (111 [52%] male; median age 14.1 years; IQR 12.7–14.9) participated in the study, 110 PHIV, 105 HIV-uninfected (36 HEU, 69 HU). PHIV initiated ART at a median age of 2.7 months (IQR 1.8–8.5). Hepatic steatosis prevalence was 9% in PHIV, 3% in HEU and 1% in HU children (p = 0.08). However, 8% of lean (body mass index z-score ≤ +1) PHIV had hepatic steatosis compared to zero lean HEU or HU children (p = 0.03). In multivariable linear regression analysis of all PHIV, body mass index (BMI) z-score was positively associated with CAP (p = 0.001) while CD4 count (p = 0.02) and duration of suppression of HIV viraemia (p = 0.009) were negatively associated with CAP, adjusting for age, sex and ethnicity. Conclusions: Hepatic steatosis prevalence was higher in lean PHIV than lean HIV-uninfected South African children. Longer suppression of HIV viraemia and higher CD4 count were associated with lower CAP and might be protective factors for hepatic steatosis in PHIV children.</td>

      <td>Quinolones as a Potential Drug in Genitourinary Cancer Treatment—A Literature Review</td>
      <td>Quinolones, broad-spectrum antibiotics, are frequently prescribed by urologists for many urological disorders. The mechanism of their bactericidal activity is based on the inhibition of topoisomerase II or IV complex with DNA, which consequently leads to cell death. It has been observed that these antibiotics also act against the analogous enzymes present in eukaryotic cells. Due to their higher accumulation in urine and prostate tissue than in serum, these drugs seem to be ideal candidates for application in genitourinary cancer treatment. In this study, an extensive literature review has been performed to collect information about concentrations achievable in urine and prostate tissue together with information about anticancer properties of 15 quinolones. Special attention was paid to the application of cytotoxic properties of quinolones for bladder and prostate cancer cell lines. Data available in the literature showed promising properties of quinolones, especially in the case of urinary bladder cancer treatment. In the case of prostate cancer, due to low concentrations of quinolones achievable in prostate tissue, combination therapy with other chemotherapeutics or another method of drug administration is necessary.</td>

Towards these aims, murine models of AML are indispensable research tools. The rapid evolution of genetic engineering techniques over the past 20 years has greatly advanced the use of murine models to mirror specific genetic subtypes of human AML, define cell-intrinsic and extrinsic disease mechanisms, study the interaction between co-occurring genetic lesions, and test novel therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes the mouse model systems that have been developed to recapitulate the most common genomic subtypes of AML.

      <td>Case Report: Exceptional Response to Poziotinib in Patient with Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutation</td>
      <td>Among the several next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) tested against uncommon EFGR alterations, poziotinib has been demonstrated to be a powerful agent for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) with aberrations in HER2 exon 20, and FDA approval is being sought in the previously-treated population. Poziotinib has also shown activity in mNSCLC with aberrations in EGFR exon 20. Herein, we report the first published case of a patient affected by mNSCLC harbouring an EGFR exon 20 insertion (EGFRex20ins) mutation who achieved a complete response (CR) under treatment with poziotinib as part of the ZENITH20 trial. In January 2021, a former smoker 62-year-old female patient was diagnosed with relapse, after two surgeries and post-operative chemotherapy of mNSCLC, at liver and retroperitoneal nodes. Given the identification by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of EGFRex20ins mutation, she was enrolled in ZENITH20-cohort 5 trial, a phase 2 multicentre study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of poziotinib in patients with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. Poziotinib as first-line systemic therapy for metastatic disease was initiated at the end of January 2021 and administrated at the initial dosage of 8 mg orally twice daily (BID). The most common side effects from the beginning of the treatment included alopecia, macular skin rash, diarrhoea, xerostomia, and conjunctivitis. Due to these adverse events, poziotinib was discontinued during the first 3 months and then reduced to 6 mg orally BID in April 2021. After the dose de-escalation, the adverse events ameliorated, and the patient better tolerated the treatment without further interruption. Since the first reevaluation (after 4 weeks of therapy), the treatment with poziotinib resulted to be remarkably effective, with a partial response (PR) subsequently confirmed in May and July 2021. Then, in October 2021, a CT scan confirmed a CR, maintained with good tolerance at the last reevaluation in February 2022. Treatment is still ongoing at the same dosage. In this case, poziotinib has represented a successful and well-tolerated first-line treatment alternative to chemotherapy in this patient with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutated mNSCLC.</td>

      <td>New classes of antibiotics are urgently needed in the fight against multidrug-resistant bacteria. Drug repurposing has emerged as an alternative approach to accelerate antimicrobial research and development. In this study, we screened a library of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulators against Staphylococcus aureus and identified five active compounds. Among them, etrasimod (APD334), an investigational drug for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, displayed the best inhibitory activity against S. aureus when growing as free-floating planktonic cells and within biofilms. In follow-up studies, etrasimod showed bactericidal activity and drastic reduction of viable bacteria within 1 h of exposure. It also displayed a potent activity against other Gram-positive bacteria, including penicillin- and methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, S. epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 5 to 10 μM (2.3–4.6 μg/mL). However, no inhibition of viability was observed against Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, showing that etrasimod preferably acts against Gram-positive bacteria. On the other hand, etrasimod was shown to inhibit quorum sensing (QS) signaling in Chromobacterium violaceum, suggesting that it may block the biofilm formation by targeting QS in certain Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, etrasimod displayed a synergistic effect with gentamicin against S. aureus, thus showing potential to be used in antibiotic combination therapy. Finally, no in vitro toxicity toward mammalian cells was observed. In conclusion, our study reports for the first time the potential of etrasimod as a repurposed antibacterial compound against Gram-positive bacteria.</td>

      <td>Tigecycline is one of important antimicrobial agents for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria. However, the emergence and prevalence of plasmid-mediated tigecycline resistance gene tet(X4) are threatening human and animal health. Fitness cost elicited by resistance plasmids is a key factor affecting the maintenance and transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the host. A comparative analysis of the fitness cost of different types of tet(X4)-positive plasmids is helpful to understand and predict the prevalence of dominant plasmids. In this study, we performed a large-scale analysis of fitness cost of tet(X4)-positive plasmids origin from clinical isolates. These plasmids were successfully electroporated into a reference strain Escherichia coli TOP10, and a series of transformants carrying the tet(X) gene were obtained. The effects of tet(X4)-positive plasmids on the growth rate, plasmid stability, relative fitness, biofilm formation, and virulence in a Galleria mellonella model were evaluated. Consequently, we found that these plasmids resulted in varying degrees of fitness cost on TOP10, including delayed bacterial growth and attenuated virulence. Out of these plasmids, tet(X4)-harboring IncFII plasmids showed the lowest fitness cost on the host. Furthermore, by means of experimental evolution in the presence of commonly used drugs in clinic, the fitness cost of tet(X4)-positive plasmids was substantially alleviated, accompanied by increased plasmid stability. Collectively, our data reveal the differential fitness cost caused by different types of tet(X4)-positive plasmids and suggest that the wide use of tetracycline antibiotics may promote the evolution of plasmids.</td>

CD5 deficiency impacts thymic selection and extra-thymic regulatory T cell generation, yet CD5 knockout was reported to cause no immune pathology. Here we show that CD5 is a key modulator of gut immunity. We generated mice with inducible CD5 knockdown (KD) in the autoimmune-prone nonobese diabetic (NOD) background. CD5 deficiency caused T cell-dependent wasting disease driven by chronic gut immune dysregulation. CD5 inhibition also exacerbated acute experimental colitis. Mechanistically, loss of CD5 increased phospho-Stat3 levels, leading to elevated IL-17A secretion. Our data reveal a new facet of CD5 function in shaping the T cell cytokine profile.</td>

      <td>Despite advances in precision medicine, the clinical prospects for patients with ovarian and uterine cancers have not substantially improved. Here, we analyzed genome-scale CRISPR–Cas9 loss-of-function screens across 851 human cancer cell lines and found that frequent overexpression of SLC34A2—encoding a phosphate importer—is correlated with sensitivity to loss of the phosphate exporter XPR1, both in vitro and in vivo. In patient-derived tumor samples, we observed frequent PAX8-dependent overexpression of SLC34A2, XPR1 copy number amplifications and XPR1 messenger RNA overexpression. Mechanistically, in SLC34A2-high cancer cell lines, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of XPR1-dependent phosphate efflux leads to the toxic accumulation of intracellular phosphate. Finally, we show that XPR1 requires the novel partner protein KIDINS220 for proper cellular localization and activity, and that disruption of this protein complex results in acidic “vacuolar” structures preceding cell death. These data point to the XPR1–KIDINS220 complex and phosphate dysregulation as a therapeutic vulnerability in ovarian cancer.</td>

      <td>Objectives: Despite excessive resistance of Helicobacter pylori to clarithromycin among the Iranian population, clarithromycin-based therapy is still prescribed in Iran. Recent studies have shown high rates of H. pylori eradication in patients treated with levofloxacin. The main purpose of this study was to compare the effect of levofloxacin with clarithromycin on the eradication of H. pylori infection in the Iranian population. Methods: A comprehensive meta-analysis was done for relevant cohort studies and clinical trials to compare the therapeutic effects of levofloxacin and clarithromycin in the Iranian population. We pooled the data using odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) to determine the clinical efficacy of levofloxacin versus clarithromycin to treat H. pylori infection. Heterogeneity and publication bias were also measured for the included studies. Results: Thirteen studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. The eradication rate was significantly higher in patients receiving levofloxacin compared with clarithromycin (75.2% vs. 66.3%; OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.40–2.20). Additionally, in the subgroup analyses it was confirmed that the cure rate was relatively higher in levofloxacin-treated cases. However, there was significant heterogeneity and publication bias, thus the results should be interpreted with caution. Conclusion: We found that the success of levofloxacin treatment was significantly higher than clarithromycin. Therefore, it is suggested that clarithromycin-based triple therapy be replaced by levofloxacin-based triple therapy in countries with high resistance to clarithromycin such as Iran. Nevertheless, the findings of this study need to be approved with a larger investigation on the Iranian population.</td>

Data on the treatment of enuresis are scarce in Sudan. We compared the efficacy of treatment with albendazole, desmopressin, and a combination of these two medications. Methodology: This is a prospective randomized hospital-based study conducted at Khartoum Children Hospital, Sudan. Children aged 5-15 years who presented with enuresis were recruited. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups (albendazole, desmopressin, or combination therapy) using a computer-generated table. The participants and clinician were aware of the treatment received by each individual. Results: A total of 71 children were enrolled; 34 (47.9%) were males and 37 (52.1%) were females. All participants were offered counseling, motivation, and toilet training. Albendazole was administered to 17 patients, desmopressin to 17 patients, and combination therapy was offered to 20 patients. Five patients initially responded to counseling, motivation, and toilet training. Nine of 17 (52.9%) patients responded well to albendazole, 8/17 (47.1%) responded to desmopressin, and finally, 15/20 (75%) responded to combined therapy. Twelve patients declined to continue during non-pharmacological treatment.

Methods: Clinical isolates were whole-genome sequenced using the Illumina and Oxford Nanopore platforms. MICs of clinical isolates and transformants containing MBL genes were determined using broth microdilution methods. Kinetic parameters of purified AFM and NDM-1 were measured using a spectrophotometer. The AFM structure was modelled with SWISS-MODEL. Results: NDTH10366 and NDTH9845 were extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates carrying bla(AFM-2) and multiple copies of bla(KPC-2), whereas WTJH17 was an XDR isolate carrying bla(AFM-3). The plasmid-borne bla(AFM-2) and bla(AFM-3) genes are associated with a novel ISCR element, ISCR29. AFM-2 and AFM-3, differing from AFM-1 by one amino acid substitution each, shared 86.2% and 86.6% amino acid sequence identity with NDM-1, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the close relationship between AFM and NDM. Expression of AFM and NDM-1 under their native promoters in DH5α and PAO1 led to elevated MICs for all tested β-lactams except aztreonam. Comparable catalytic abilities were observed for AFM and NDM-1 when hydrolysing nitrocefin, cefepime, imipenem and biapenem, whereas for other tested β-lactams AFM displayed weaker enzymatic activities. Modelling AFM structure revealed a characteristic αβ/βα fold with two zinc-binding active sites. Conclusions: AFM from clinical P. aeruginosa isolates demonstrated β-lactamase activity comparable to NDM-1. Co-carriage of bla(AFM) and bla(KPC) renders clinical P. aeruginosa isolates non-susceptible to all antipseudomonal β-lactams. The association of bla(AFM) genes with translocatable genetic elements and plasmids highlights their concerning potential for dissemination.</td>

As many as 50% of C. auris clinical isolates are reported to be resistant to amphotericin B, but no mechanisms contributing to this resistance have been identified. Here we describe a clinical case in which high-level amphotericin B resistance was acquired in vivo during therapy and undertake molecular and genetic studies to identify and characterize the genetic determinant of resistance. Methods: Whole-genome sequencing was performed on four C. auris isolates obtained from a single patient case. Cas9-mediated genetic manipulations were then used to generate mutant strains harbouring mutations of interest, and these strains were subsequently subjected to amphotericin B susceptibility testing and comprehensive sterol profiling. Results: A novel mutation in the C. auris sterol-methyltransferase gene ERG6 was found to be associated with amphotericin B resistance, and this mutation alone conferred a &gt;32-fold increase in amphotericin B resistance. Comprehensive sterol profiling revealed an abrogation of ergosterol biosynthesis and a corresponding accumulation of cholesta-type sterols in isolates and strains harbouring the clinically derived ERG6 mutation. Conclusions: Together these findings definitively demonstrate mutations in C. auris ERG6 as the first identified mechanism of clinical amphotericin B resistance in C. auris and represent a significant step forward in the understanding of antifungal resistance in this emerging public health threat.</td>

      <td>MPI8, a peptidyl aldehyde, is a potent antiviral agent against coronavirus. Due to unique tri-peptide bonds and the formyl functional group, the bioassay of MPI8 in plasma was challenged by a strong interference from water MPI8. Using QTOF LC-MS/MS, we identified MPI8•H(2)O as the major interference form that co-existed with MPI8 in aqueous and biological media. To avoid the resolution of MPI8 and MPI8•H(2)O observed on reverse phase columns, we found that a Kinetex hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column provided co-elution of both MPI8 and MPI8•H(2)O with a good single chromatographic peak and column retention of MPI8 which is suitable for quantification. Thus, a sensitive, specific, and reproducible LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of MPI8 in rat plasma was developed and validated using a triple QUAD LC-MS/MS. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a Kinetex HILIC column with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min under gradient elution. The calibration curves were linear (r2 &gt; 0.99) over MPI8 concentrations from 0.5-500 ng/mL. The accuracy and precision are within acceptable guidance levels. The mean matrix effect and recovery were 139% and 73%, respectively. No significant degradation of MPI8 occurred under the experimental conditions. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of MPI8 after administration of MPI8 sulfonate in rats.</td>

      <td>Green phytoextracts as natural photosensitizers in LED-based photodynamic disinfection of multidrug-resistant bacteria in wastewater effluent</td>
      <td>The photodynamic treatment (PDT) process is a promising technology to control emerging pollutants and antimicrobial resistance problems in the water environment. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced when natural and nontoxic photosensitizers (PS) are exposed to light are the key functional components of the PDT process that can effectively achieve microbial inactivation with minimal negative impact. This study examined the application of green phytoextracts from two plants, Chamaecyparis obtusa and Moringa oleifera, as natural photosensitizers for the white light-emitting diode (LED) based photodynamic disinfection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and total coliforms (TC) from secondary effluent in full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the phytoextracts contained 57 compounds, particularly aromatic and phenolic hydroxyl compounds. The phytoextracts showed an excellent activity as a PS compared to the intrinsic antibacterial effect. Under a light intensity of 17 mW/cm(2), the complete inactivation (6.55 Log CFU/mL) was observed at an irradiation time of 100 min for Escherichia coli ART-2 and 80 min for Staphylococcus aureus, meaning that E. coli was resistant. The light intensity was an important factor influencing photodynamic disinfection. For the complete disinfection of TC satisfying the water reclamation regulation, the irradiation time requirement was 20 min under a light intensity of 80 mW/cm(2). During the photodynamic reaction, a significant amount of ROS was generated from the phytoextracts as the light irradiation time was increased. The major ROS was singlet oxygen ((1)O(2), Type II) during the initial 40 min of reaction time and hydroxyl radical (•OH, Type I) after 40 min until complete inactivation.</td>

Yet, there is no up-to-date synthesized evidence on the prevalence of self-medication that is attributable to the pandemic. This study aimed to conduct a systematic literature review on the prevalence and correlates of self-medication for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 globally. The review was registered with the PROSPERO database. Searches were conducted following PRISMA guidelines, and relevant articles published between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2022 were included. Pooled prevalence rate was conducted using the Meta package in R. A total of 14 studies from 14 countries, which represented 15,154 participants, were included. The prevalence of COVID-19-related self-medication ranged from 3.4–96%. The pooled prevalence of self-medication for this purpose was 44.9% (95% CI: 23.8%, 68.1%). Medications reported by studies for self-medication were antibiotics (79%), vitamins (64%), antimalarials (50%), herbal and natural products (50%), analgesics and antipyretics (43%), minerals and supplements (43%), cold and allergy preparations (29%), corticosteroids (14%), and antivirals (7%). The prevalence of self-medication with antibiotics is concerning. More public health education about responsible self-medication amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics is required to mitigate the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance.</td>

Liquid crystal nanoparticles (LCNPs) advance the efficacy of tobramycin in biofilm-related infections by increasing the penetration of antibiotics across the biofilm matrix. Herewith, we develop the LCNPs as a platform technology, demonstrating that the LCNPs can increase the efficacy of two antibiotic classes (i.e. aminoglycosides and colistin) in P. aeruginosa biofilm infections. In C. elegans, the LCNPs potentiated the antimicrobial effect and significantly improved the survival of the nematodes. In mice with a full-thickness excisional wound, LCNPs were non-toxic and did not impair wound repair. Compared to the unformulated antibiotic treatment, tobramycin-LCNPs reduced the chronic bacterial load by 100-fold in the wound. This was also emulated in an ex vivo P. aeruginosa porcine wound infection model. The LCNPs represent a versatile platform technology that improves the efficacy of cationic antibiotics against biofilm infections utilizing multiple administration routes.</td>

      <td>The AI-Assisted Identification and Clinical Efficacy of Baricitinib in the Treatment of COVID-19</td>
      <td>During the current pandemic, the vast majority of COVID-19 patients experienced mild symptoms, but some had a potentially fatal aberrant hyperinflammatory immune reaction characterized by high levels of IL-6 and other cytokines. Modulation of this immune reaction has proven to be the only method of reducing mortality in severe and critical COVID-19. The anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib (Olumiant) has recently been strongly recommended by the WHO for use in COVID-19 patients because it reduces the risk of progressive disease and death. It is a Janus Kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor approved for rheumatoid arthritis which was suggested in early 2020 as a treatment for COVID-19. In this review the AI-assisted identification of baricitinib, its antiviral and antiinflammatory properties, and efficacy in clinical trials are discussed and compared with those of other immune modulators including glucocorticoids, IL-6 and IL-1 receptor blockers and other JAK inhibitors. Baricitinib inhibits both virus infection and cytokine signalling and is not only important for COVID-19 management but is “non-immunological”, and so should remain effective if new SARS-CoV-2 variants escape immune control. The repurposing of baricitinib is an example of how advanced artificial intelligence (AI) can quickly identify new drug candidates that have clinical benefit in previously unsuspected therapeutic areas.</td>

      <td>Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum oral antiviral agent that shows in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Presently, data on the real-world effectiveness and optimal dosage of favipiravir for treating COVID-19 are limited. We conducted a retrospective observational study of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 at five tertiary care hospitals in Thailand. We reviewed patient charts to obtain all necessary data. Among 247 COVID-19 patients, 63 (23.0%) received ≥1 dose of favipiravir. Of these 63 patients, 61.9% were male with a median age of 48 years (range 22–85 years), 27.0% required an O(2) nasal cannula, 9.5% required non-invasive ventilation and/or high-flow O(2) therapy, and 6.4% required invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO. The median baseline NEWS2 score was 5 (0–16). The Day-7 clinical improvement rate [95%CI] was 66.7% [53.7–78.0%] in all patients, 92.5% [75.7–99.1%] in patients who did not require O(2) supplementation, and 47.2% [0.4–64.5%] in patients who required O(2) supplementation. No life-threatening adverse events were identified. The 28-day mortality rate was 4.8%. A multivariate analysis revealed three poor prognostic factors for Day-7 clinical improvement (odds ratio (95%CI); p-value): older age (0.94 (0.89–0.99); p = 0.04), a higher baseline NEWS2 score (0.64 (0.47–0.88); p = 0.006), and a lower favipiravir loading dose (≤45 mg/kg/day) (0.04 (0.005–0.4); p = 0.006). In conclusion, our study reports the promising effectiveness of favipiravir for treating COVID-19 patients. In addition to older age and a high baseline NEWS2 score, a low loading dose of favipiravir (≤45 mg/kg/day) was also identified as a poor prognostic factor for early clinical improvement. Further studies to explore the optimal dose and the optimal timing of drug initiation for favipiravir should be performed.</td>

      <td>Background: Cutaneous mucormycosis, while less common than sinonasal or pulmonary infections, can cause widespread tissue necrosis after seemingly innocuous encounters. The most common location of cutaneous mucormycosis is the extremities, and extensive infection has been reported after trauma or orthopedic procedures. Case Report: A 60-year-old female with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus sustained an open patella fracture after a fall. She underwent washout and internal fixation with cannulated screws and cable tension band wiring. The patient’s recovery was complicated by asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and repeated wound dehiscence, with growth of Mucor species initially presumed to be a contaminant. Despite serial washout and debridement, repeat dehiscence and patella exposure were noted. Free tissue transfer to the genicular vessels was selected for coverage of the extensor tendon, patella, and fracture line. In repeat skin cultures, Mucor indicus and Staphylococcus epidermidis grew from the wound. Topical voriconazole and a 6-week course of intravenous isavuconazole and oral doxycycline were started when the Mucor cultures were identified. Conclusion: This case highlights an approach to an indolent mucormycosis infection in the skin over a patella fracture in a patient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, including the sequence of surgical care, debridement, and selection of antimicrobials. Major amputation and orthopedic revision were avoided. This patient also underwent successful free tissue transfer after testing positive for COVID-19.</td>

Cerebral mucormycosis has been reported, but cases have primar-ily been unilateral. We report a case of bilateral cerebral mucormycosis in an immunocompetent patient. Case Report: A 37-year-old female with no significant medical history was transferred to our tertiary center after cerebrospinal fluid profile following a lumbar puncture at an outside hospital suggested bacterial meningitis. Computed tomography of the head revealed hypodensity and cerebral edema in the left basal ganglia, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed increased T2 signal and mass-like configuration centered in the left basal ganglia. During her hospital stay, she had neurologic decompensation with respiratory failure. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Repeat MRI brain revealed evolving cerebral edema signal and interval development of progression across the midline involving the right basal ganglia. Because of the aggressive nature of the lesion and cerebral edema, she underwent a biopsy with placement of an external ventricular drain. Despite medical and surgical interventions, she neurologically worsened and died. Histopathologic evaluation of the biopsied lesion revealed numerous fungal hyphae consistent with mucormycosis. Conclusion: Our patient was not immunocompromised, and this case highlights the clinical challenges in initiating immunosup-pressive therapy in a patient with rapidly progressive central nervous system disease.</td>

      <td>The reversibility of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine, over a period of five years, the effect of fluoroquinolone (FQ) use in primary care on the development and gradual decay of Escherichia coli resistance to FQ. In this matched case–control study, we linked three sources of secondary data of the Health Service of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italy. Cases were all those with an FQ-resistant E. coli (QREC)-positive culture from any site during a 2016 hospital stay. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression. A total of 409 cases were matched to 993 controls (FQ-sensitive E. coli) by the date of the first isolate. Patients taking one or more courses of FQ were at higher risk of QREC colonization/infection. The risk was highest during the first year after FQ was taken (OR 2.67, 95%CI 1.92–3.70, p &lt; 0.0001), decreased during the second year (OR 1.54, 95%CI 1.09–2.17, p = 0.015) and became undetectable afterwards (OR 1.09, 95%CI 0.80–1.48, p = 0.997). In the first year, the risk of resistance was highest after greater cumulative exposure to FQs. Moreover, older age, male sex, longer hospital stays, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes mellitus were independent risk factors for QREC colonization/infection. A single FQ course significantly increases the risk of QREC colonization/infection for no less than two years. This risk is higher in cases of multiple courses, longer hospital stays, COPD and diabetes; in males; and in older patients. These findings may inform public campaigns and courses directed to prescribers to promote rational antibiotic use.</td>

Bacterial identification, drug susceptibility tests, and DNA sequencing were performed, followed by in silico resistance genes identification. All isolates showed extensively drug-resistant (XDR) phenotypes. Four different sequence types (ST) were detected: ST16, ST11, ST258, and ST437. Nineteen isolates were responsible for an outbreak in the ICU in September 2020. They belong to ST258 and harbored the 42Kb IncX3plasmid (pKP98M3N42) with the same genomic pattern of two K. pneumoniae identified in 2018. Twenty-four isolates carried bla(-KPC-2) gene. No plasmid-mediated colistin (mcr) resistance genes were found. Eight isolates presented mgrB gene mutation. The clonal isolates responsible for the outbreak came from patients submitted to pronation, with high mortality rates in one month. XDR-K. pneumoniae detected during the outbreak presented chromosomal resistance to PB and plasmid-acquired carbapenem resistance due to KPC production in most isolates and 42Kb IncX3(pKP98M3N42) plasmid carrying bla(KPC-2) was associated with ST258 isolates.

Here, we investigated the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) resistance genes of E. coli from companion animals in Shandong, China. A total of 79 isolates (80.6%) were recovered from 98 healthy or diarrheal companion animals in 2021, among which ESBLs-producing isolates accounted for 43.0% (34/79), and more than half of ESBL E. coli (ESBL-EC) strains (n = 19) were isolated from healthy companion animals. Diarrheagenic E. coli isolates (45.6%, n = 36) were represented by enterotoxigenic (ETEC) (32.9%), enteropathogenic (EPEC) (10.1%) and enteroinvasive (EIEC) (2.6%), 20 isolates of which were from healthy pets. Among tested antibiotics, resistance to tetracycline (64.6%) was the most commonly observed, followed by doxycycline (59.5%) and ampicillin (53.2%). Notably, all isolates were susceptible to meropenem. The multidrug-resistant (MDR) rate was 49.4%, 20 isolates of which were ESBLs producers; moreover, 23.4%, 16.4% of ESBL-EC strains were resistant to 5 or more, 7 or more antibiotics, respectively. Among the 5 β-lactamase resistance genes, the most frequent gene was blaCTX-M (60.76%), followed by blaSHV (40.51%). The plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) gene aac(6’)-Ib-cr was detected in 35 isolates. Additionally, ESBL-associated genes (i.e., blaCTX-M, blaSHV) were found in 76.5% ESBL-EC strains, with six isolates carrying blaCTX-M and blaSHV. The marker gene of high-pathogenicity island gene irp2 (encoding iron capture systems) was the most frequency virulence gene. Our results showed that ESBL-EC were widespread in healthy or diarrhea companion animals, especially healthy pets, which may be a potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance, therefore, enhancing a risk to public and animal health.</td>

Fifty-one out of two hundred and three (51/203 or 25.12%) of the examined strains showed a synergistic effect for the meropenem plus ertapenem combination throughout the checkerboard method, while only three isolates showed potential clinically relevant synergy (3/203, 1.48%). An additive effect was observed in 55/203 (27.09%) of the examined strains. Ninety-seven of the examined isolates (47.78%) showed fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) greater or equal to 2 (indicating antagonism). The synergistic activity of meropenem plus ertapenem combination suggests this combination can be a possible way to treat the infection caused by the carbapenem-resistant organisms, especially for IMP or NDM producer with a lesser minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the infected individual who was not recommended to use colistin or tigecycline.</td>

The limited arsenal of available antifungal drugs, coupled with the lack of momentum for the development of new reagents, represent a challenge in the management of such a pathogen. In this perspective, we have focused on discussing new, promising treatment options for C. auris infections. These novel drugs include an antifungal agent already approved for medical use in the United States of America, compounds that are already in clinical trials and those with potential for repurposing use against this important fungal pathogen.</td>

      <td>COVID-19 in G6PD-deficient Patients, Oxidative Stress, and Neuropathology</td>
      <td>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme that regulates energy metabolism mainly through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). It is well known that this enzyme participates in the antioxidant/oxidant balance via the synthesis of energy-rich molecules: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced (NADPH), the reduced form of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH) and glutathione (GSH), controlling reactive oxygen species generation. Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a public health problem that has caused approximately 4.5 million deaths since December 2019. Concerning the role of G6PD in COVID-19 development, it is known from the existing literature that G6PD-deficient patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are more susceptible to thrombosis and hemolysis, suggesting that G6PD deficiency facilitates infection by SARS-CoV-2. Concerning G6PD and neuropathology, it has been observed that deficiency of this enzyme is also present with an increase in oxidative markers. Concerning the role of G6PD and the neurological manifestations of COVID-19, it has been reported that the enzymatic deficiency in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 exacerbates the disease, and, in some clinical reports, an increase in hemolysis and thrombosis was observed when patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine (OH-CQ), a drug with oxidative properties. In the present work, we summarize the evidence of the role of G6PD in COVID-19 and its possible role in the generation of oxidative stress and glucose metabolism deficits, and inflammation present in this respiratory disease and its progression including neurological manifestations.</td>

      <td>Background: Enterococcus faecalis rapidly develops resistance to different antibiotics, thereby resulting in serious nosocomial infections associated with high mortality rates and different problems in the healthcare systems. Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the genetic diversity, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence factors of E. faecalis isolates obtained from the stool samples of patients in a hospital in the center of Iran. Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study, 108 stool samples were collected from September 2019 to February 2020 from 108 patients hospitalized in a hospital in the center of Iran. Enterococcus faecalis isolates were detected using the ddlE gene detection technique, and antimicrobial resistance testing was performed using the disc agar diffusion method. Moreover, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors. Genetic diversity was also analyzed by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus using PCR (ERIC-PCR). The BioNumerics software was used to construct a dendrogram. Results: Of 108 isolates, 50 samples were E. faecalis (46.2%). The prevalence of multidrug resistance among E. faecalis isolates was 62%, and most isolates were resistant to antibiotics tetracycline (70%), erythromycin (68%), and rifampin (60%). Among the E. faecalis isolates, the most prevalent antimicrobial resistance genes were ermB (96%), aph (2(′′)) Ia (66%), aac(6(′))-Ie (40%), and ermC (30%), and the most prevalent virulence genes were gelE (78%), asa1 (74%), and esp (74%). The genetic diversity analysis showed 25 ERIC types in two major clusters (ie, clusters H and J) and eight minor clusters (ie, clusters A-G and I). There was no significant difference between clusters H and J in terms of antimicrobial resistance and resistance genes (P &gt; 0.05). In contrast, the prevalence of the asa1 gene was significantly higher in cluster J than in cluster H (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: This study showed the high prevalence of multidrug resistance, and high heterogeneity among the E. faecalis isolates obtained from the stool samples of hospitalized patients.</td>

In this study, we present an unique MMP case with oral mucosal lesions, which showed positive IgA signals on basement membrane zone in indirect immunofluorescence using normal human skin and on dermal side in indirect immunofluorescence using salt-split skin, positive IgA autoantibodies against LMγ1 by immunoblotting of epidermal extracts, positive IgA autoantibodies against LMα5 by immunoblotting of LM521 recombinant protein (rLM521) and positive IgG autoantibodies against LMγ1 by immunoblotting of rLM111 and rLM521 at first visit (Day 0). After therapy, further serological analyses of serum samples collected at Day 30 and Day 50 indicated that IgA autoantibodies against LMγ1 were likely to be pathogenic. These results suggest that LMγ1 is another autoantigen of MMP, and our patient might be the first reported case of anti-LMγ1 MMP.</td>

      <td>We report within-host evolution of antibiotic resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin in a nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae strain from a patient with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), who received repeated or prolonged treatment with these antibiotics for recurrent respiratory tract infections. Whole-genome sequencing of three longitudinally collected sputum isolates during the period April 2016 to January 2018 revealed persistence of a strain of sequence type 2386. Reduced susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the first two isolates was associated with mutations in genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase (folA) and its promotor region, dihydropteroate synthase (folP), and thymidylate synthase (thyA), while subsequent substitution of a single amino acid in dihydropteroate synthase (G225A) rendered high-level resistance in the third isolate from 2018. Azithromycin co-resistance in this isolate was associated with amino acid substitutions in 50S ribosomal proteins L4 (W59R) and L22 (G91D), possibly aided by a substitution in AcrB (A604E) of the AcrAB efflux pump. All three isolates were resistant to aminopenicillins and cefotaxime due to TEM-1B beta-lactamase and identical alterations in penicillin-binding protein 3. Further resistance development to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin resulted in a multidrug-resistant phenotype. Evolution of multidrug resistance due to horizontal gene transfer and/or spontaneous mutations, along with selection of resistant subpopulations is a particular risk in CVID and other patients requiring repeated and prolonged antibiotic treatment or prophylaxis. Such challenging situations call for careful antibiotic stewardship together with supportive and supplementary treatment. We describe the clinical and microbiological course of events in this case report and address the challenges encountered.</td>

      <td>Unusually for a viral infection, the immunological phenotype of severe COVID-19 is characterised by a depleted lymphocyte and elevated neutrophil count, with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio correlating with disease severity. Neutrophils are the most abundant immune cell in the bloodstream and comprise different subpopulations with pleiotropic actions that are vital for host immunity. Unique neutrophil subpopulations vary in their capacity to mount antimicrobial responses, including NETosis (the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps), degranulation and de novo production of cytokines and chemokines. These processes play a role in antiviral immunity, but may also contribute to the local and systemic tissue damage seen in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neutrophils also contribute to complications of COVID-19 such as thrombosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multisystem inflammatory disease in children. In this Progress review, we discuss the anti-viral and pathological roles of neutrophils in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and potential therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 that target neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses.</td>

      <td>Stress-adaptive mechanisms enable tumour cells to overcome metabolic constraints under nutrient and oxygen shortage. Aspartate is an endogenous metabolic limitation under hypoxic conditions, but the nature of the adaptive mechanisms that contribute to aspartate availability and hypoxic tumour growth are poorly understood. Here we identify GOT2-catalysed mitochondrial aspartate synthesis as an essential metabolic dependency for the proliferation of pancreatic tumour cells under hypoxic culture conditions. In contrast, GOT2-catalysed aspartate synthesis is dispensable for pancreatic tumour formation in vivo. The dependence of pancreatic tumour cells on aspartate synthesis is bypassed in part by a hypoxia-induced potentiation of extracellular protein scavenging via macropinocytosis. This effect is mutant KRAS dependent, and is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1A) and its canonical target carbonic anhydrase-9 (CA9). Our findings reveal high plasticity of aspartate metabolism and define an adaptive regulatory role for macropinocytosis by which mutant KRAS﻿ tumours can overcome nutrient deprivation under hypoxic conditions.</td>

      <td>Background: Myiasis, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is infection with fly larvae commonly occurring in tropical and subtropical areas. Whereas the presentation of skin infection with organisms such as Dermatobia hominis (human botfly) is more easily recognized in these regions, identification of myiasis in the United States is difficult due to its rarity. Due to unspecific signs and symptoms, myiasis may initially be mistaken for other conditions, like cellulitis. Case Report: This case details a patient with pain, swelling, drainage, and erythema of the right second toe. The patient recently returned from Belize and reported an insect bite to the area approximately 1 month prior. She had been seen by health care professionals twice prior to presenting to our Emergency Department (ED) due to increasing pain. At those visits, the patient was prescribed antibiotics, failing to improve her symptoms. In the ED, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) of the soft tissue was performed and showed evidence of a foreign body consistent with cutaneous myiasis. Given the patient's history of travel to Belize and known insect bite, it is prudent to have an increased suspicion for cutaneous myiasis. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: To prevent a delay in diagnosis and unnecessary antibiotics, clinicians should have a high level of suspicion for botfly if a patient reports recent travel in an endemic region and pain disproportionate to an insect bite. POCUS contributes to a more efficient recognition of the disease.</td>

      <td>Treatment options for children with Rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) remain limited, and para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) is still a relevant component of treatment regimens. Prevention of resistance to companion drugs by PAS is dose related, and at higher concentrations, PAS may exhibit significant bactericidal activity in addition to its bacteriostatic properties. The optimal dosing of PAS in children is uncertain, specifically for delayed-release granule preparations, which are the most used. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed describing PAS pharmacokinetics in children receiving routine RR-TB treatment. Model-based simulations evaluated current World Health Organization (WHO) weight-band doses against the adult pharmacokinetic target of 50 to 100 mg/liter for peak concentrations. Of 27 children included, the median (range) age and weight were 3.87 (0.58 to 13.7) years and 13.3 (7.15 to 30.5) kg, respectively; 4 (14.8%) were HIV positive. PAS followed one-compartment kinetics with first-order elimination and transit compartment absorption. The typical clearance in a 13-kg child was 9.79 liters/h. Increased PAS clearance was observed in both pharmacokinetic profiles from the only patient receiving efavirenz. No effect of renal function, sex, ethnicity, nutritional status, HIV status, antiretrovirals (lamivudine, abacavir, and lopinavir-ritonavir), or RR-TB drugs was detected. In simulations, target concentrations were achieved only using the higher WHO dose range of 300 mg/kg once daily. A transit compartment adequately describes absorption for the slow-release PAS formulation. Children should be dosed at the higher range of current WHO-recommended PAS doses and in a once-daily dose to optimize treatment.</td>

      <td>Ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/r) and dolutegravir (DTG) are affected by induction of metabolizing enzymes and efflux transporters caused by rifampicin (RIF). This complicates the treatment of people living with HIV (PLWH) diagnosed with tuberculosis. Recent data showed that doubling DRV/r dose did not compensate for this effect, and hepatic safety was unsatisfactory. We aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of DRV, ritonavir (RTV), and DTG in the presence and absence of RIF in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PLWH were enrolled in a dose-escalation crossover study with 6 treatment periods of 7 days. Participants started with DRV/r 800/100 mg once daily (QD), RIF and DTG were added before the RTV dose was doubled, and then they received DRV/r 800/100 twice daily (BD) and then 1,600/200 QD or vice versa. Finally, RIF was withdrawn. Plasma and intra-PBMC drug concentrations were measured through validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. Seventeen participants were enrolled but only 4 completed all study phases due to high incidence of liver toxicity. Intra-PBMC DRV trough serum concentration (C(trough)) after the addition of RIF dropped from a median (interquartile range [IQR]) starting value of 261 ng/mL (158 to 577) to 112 ng/mL (18 to 820) and 31 ng/mL (12 to 331) for 800/100 BD and 1,600/200 QD DRV/r doses, respectively. The DRV intra-PBMC/plasma ratio increased significantly (P = 0.003). DTG and RIF intra-PBMC concentrations were in accordance with previous reports in the absence of RIF or DRV/r. This study showed a differential impact of enzyme and/or transporter induction on DRV/r concentrations in plasma and PBMCs, highlighting the usefulness of studying intra-PBMC pharmacokinetics with drug-drug interactions.

Methods: We enrolled 100 patients to receive intravenous (IV) C/T or SOC antibiotics (cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, or meropenem) in combination with gram-positive antibacterial agents. We evaluated responses at the end of IV therapy (EOIV), test of cure (TOC; days 21-28), and late follow-up (LFU; days 35-42). Results: We analyzed 47 C/T patients and 50 SOC patients. C/T patients had a higher rate of favorable clinical response at EOIV (87% vs 72%). A 1-sided noninferiority analysis indicated that C/T was at least not inferior to the SOC for favorable clinical response at EOIV (P = .002), TOC (P = .004), and LFU (P = .002). Superiority tests showed that C/T led to significantly lower rates of clinical failure at TOC (6% vs 30%; P = .003) and LFU (9% vs 30%; P = .008). C/T and SOC patients with documented infections had similar rates of favorable microbiological response. Serious adverse events leading to drug discontinuation (2% vs 0%; P = .48) and overall mortality (6% vs 4%; P = .67) were similar in both groups. Conclusions: The empiric use of C/T in high-risk patients with hematological malignancies and febrile neutropenia is safe and associated with better clinical outcomes than SOC antimicrobial agents.</td>

      <td>The Neisseria gonorrhoeae type IV pilus promotes resistance to hydrogen peroxide- and LL-37-mediated killing by modulating the availability of intracellular, labile iron</td>
      <td>The Neisseria gonorrhoeae Type IV pilus is a multifunctional, dynamic fiber involved in host cell attachment, DNA transformation, and twitching motility. We previously reported that the N. gonorrhoeae pilus is also required for resistance against hydrogen peroxide-, antimicrobial peptide LL-37-, and non-oxidative, neutrophil-mediated killing. We tested whether the hydrogen peroxide, LL-37, and neutrophil hypersensitivity phenotypes in non-piliated N. gonorrhoeae could be due to elevated iron levels. Iron chelation in the growth medium rescued a nonpiliated pilE mutant from both hydrogen peroxide- and antimicrobial peptide LL-37-mediated killing, suggesting these phenotypes are related to iron availability. We used the antibiotic streptonigrin, which depends on free cytoplasmic iron and oxidation to kill bacteria, to determine whether piliation affected intracellular iron levels. Several non-piliated, loss-of-function mutants were more sensitive to streptonigrin killing than the piliated parental strain. Consistent with the idea that higher available iron levels in the under- and non-piliated strains were responsible for the higher streptonigrin sensitivity, iron limitation by desferal chelation restored resistance to streptonigrin in these strains and the addition of iron restored the sensitivity to streptonigrin killing. The antioxidants tiron and dimethylthiourea rescued the pilE mutant from streptonigrin-mediated killing, suggesting that the elevated labile iron pool in non-piliated bacteria leads to streptonigrin-dependent reactive oxygen species production. These antioxidants did not affect LL-37-mediated killing. We confirmed that the pilE mutant is not more sensitive to other antibiotics showing that the streptonigrin phenotypes are not due to general bacterial envelope disruption. The total iron content of the cell was unaltered by piliation when measured using ICP-MS suggesting that only the labile iron pool is affected by piliation. These results support the hypothesis that piliation state affects N. gonorrhoeae iron homeostasis and influences sensitivity to various host-derived antimicrobial agents.</td>

      <td>RANBP2 and USP9x regulate nuclear import of adenovirus minor coat protein IIIa</td>
      <td>As intracellular parasites, viruses exploit cellular proteins at every stage of infection. Adenovirus outbreaks are associated with severe acute respiratory illnesses and conjunctivitis, with no specific antiviral therapy available. An adenoviral vaccine based on human adenovirus species D (HAdV-D) is currently in use for COVID-19. Herein, we investigate host interactions of HAdV-D type 37 (HAdV-D37) protein IIIa (pIIIa), identified by affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP-MS) screens. We demonstrate that viral pIIIa interacts with ubiquitin-specific protease 9x (USP9x) and Ran-binding protein 2 (RANBP2). USP9x binding did not invoke its signature deubiquitination function but rather deregulated pIIIa-RANBP2 interactions. In USP9x-knockout cells, viral genome replication and viral protein expression increased compared to wild type cells, supporting a host-favored mechanism for USP9x. Conversely, RANBP2-knock down reduced pIIIa transport to the nucleus, viral genome replication, and viral protein expression. Also, RANBP2-siRNA pretreated cells appeared to contain fewer mature viral particles. Transmission electron microscopy of USP9x-siRNA pretreated, virus-infected cells revealed larger than typical paracrystalline viral arrays. RANBP2-siRNA pretreatment led to the accumulation of defective assembly products at an early maturation stage. CRM1 nuclear export blockade by leptomycin B led to the retention of pIIIa within cell nuclei and hindered pIIIa-RANBP2 interactions. In-vitro binding analyses indicated that USP9x and RANBP2 bind to C-terminus of pIIIa amino acids 386–563 and 386–510, respectively. Surface plasmon resonance testing showed direct pIIIa interaction with recombinant USP9x and RANBP2 proteins, without competition. Using an alternative and genetically disparate adenovirus type (HAdV-C5), we show that the demonstrated pIIIa interaction is also important for a severe respiratory pathogen. Together, our results suggest that pIIIa hijacks RANBP2 for nuclear import and subsequent virion assembly. USP9x counteracts this interaction and negatively regulates virion synthesis. This analysis extends the scope of known adenovirus-host interactions and has potential implications in designing new antiviral therapeutics.</td>

      <td>Objectives: The objective of the study was to determine practice patterns of prescribing prophylactic antibiotics against urinary tract infection (UTI) for urodynamic studies (UDS) and outpatient cystoscopy in women. Design: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted of North American female pelvic medicine and reconstructive specialists (FPMRS). Methods: An online survey was used to assess prophylactic prescribing patterns of FPMRS that perform UDS and outpatient cystoscopy. This survey was developed and then electronically disseminated through the American Urogynecologic Society to 699 eligible physicians. Results: A total of 138 surveys were completed. Approximately half of physicians did not prescribe any antibiotic prophylaxis for UDS or for cystoscopy (54% and 43%, respectively). For patients with perceived risk factors (recurrent UTIs, immunosuppression, known neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, indwelling catheter use, elevated postvoid residual/bladder outlet obstruction, genitourinary anomalies, and diabetes), 32% and 41% of physicians prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis for UDS and cystoscopy, respectively. A minority of physicians always prescribed antibiotics for UDS and cystoscopy (13% and 17%, respectively). Limitations: The response rate was a limitation of the study; however, this rate is in keeping with other physician survey studies published within this subspecialty. Selection and response biases may have contributed to the results of this survey study. Conclusion: There was no uniform approach to UTI prophylaxis for UDS and outpatient cystoscopy in women which reflects the lack of current guidelines and the low level of evidence on which they are based. This nonuniform practice calls for more research to better define an evidence-based standard of care.</td>

      <td>Clinical and Genomic Investigation of an International Ceftriaxone- and Azithromycin-Resistant Shigella sonnei Cluster among Men Who Have Sex with Men, Montréal, Canada 2017–2019</td>
      <td>Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Shigella sonnei have become prevalent among men who have sex with men and have become a global public health concern. From June 2017 to April 2019, 32 men were infected with MDR S. sonnei acquired locally, in Montréal, which was suggestive of an outbreak. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), phylogenetic analysis, antimicrobial resistance and virulence characterization, and association to international clusters were performed. The outbreak strain was ceftriaxone- and azithromycin-resistant due to the acquisition of bla(CTX-M-27), and mphA and ermB genes, respectively, with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin due to a single point mutation (gyrA S83L). One out of 27 patients treated with a fluoroquinolone experienced microbiological failure. Epidemiological evidence first supported by a rare unique MDR Shigella sonnei documented only in men in 2017 followed by similar pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles was confirmed by WGS. A core genome high-quality single-nucleotide variant (hqSNV)-based phylogeny found a median of 6 hqSNV differences among isolates. Virulence gene content was investigated, but no Shiga toxins were detected. An international cluster of highly related isolates was identified (PDS000019750.208) and belonged to the 3.7.29.1.4.1 S. sonnei genotype (Global III VN2.KH1.Aus). Genomic analysis revealed that this Montréal cluster was connected to other documented outbreaks in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. This study highlights the urgent need for public health measures to focus on the prevention and the early detection of S. sonnei, since global transmission patterns of MDR strains is concerning and few antimicrobial treatment options are available. IMPORTANCE Shigella sonnei, an important foodborne pathogen, recently became a frequent sexually transmitted agent involved in large and persistent outbreaks globally among men who have sex with men. Most strains also harbor several multidrug-resistant (MDR) determinants of particular concern. This study characterizes an outbreak strain at the source of an important MDR cluster identified in Montréal in 2017. Associations were made to many high-profile international outbreaks, and the causative S. sonnei lineage of these clusters was identified, which was not evident in past reports. The worldwide occurrence of this strain is of concern since treatment with antimicrobials like ceftriaxone and azithromycin may not be effective, and rare microbiological failures have been documented in patients treated with ciprofloxacin. Our investigation highlights the threats of Shigella spp. infection and the necessity for antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring in order to mitigate S. sonnei’s impact on public health and to avoid transmission to other at-risk communities.</td>

      <td>Background: To investigate the etiological characteristics and risk factors of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) urinary tract infection (UTI) and construct a corresponding nomogram to predict the probability of ESBL(+) UTI. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records among patients experiencing UTI events in Chongqing Medical University Affiliated Children’s Hospital from 1994 and 2019. Results: A total of 854 patients with UTI were evaluated and ESBL-producing bacteria increased significantly. Significant potential risk factors of ESBL-UTI were congenital urological abnormalities, vesicoureteral reflux, neurologic disorder, age &lt;12 months, fever and previous use of antibiotics. On logistic regression analysis, neurological disorder (OR =8, 95% CI: 1.845–34.695) and antibiotics administration in the last 3 months (OR =4.764, 95% CI: 3.114–7.289) were identified as an independent significant risk factor for ESBL-UTI. The nomogram generated was well calibrated for all predictions of ESBL+ probability, and the accuracy of the model nomogram measured by Harrell’s C statistic (C-index) was 0.741. Conclusions: The current situation of multiple bacterial antibiotic resistance has become a worrisome issue in UTI and early identification of ESBL production is important in terms of appropriate treatment and effective infection control. We may choose broad-spectrum antibiotics as empirical antibiotics for UTI among children with neurological disease and used antibiotic in the last three months.</td>

      <td>PURPOSEThe combination of venetoclax and 5-azacitidine (5-AZA) for older or unfit patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) improves remission rates and survival compared with 5-AZA alone. We hypothesized that the addition of venetoclax to cladribine (CLAD)/low-dose araC (low-dose cytarabine [LDAC]) alternating with 5-AZA backbone may further improve outcomes for older patients with newly diagnosed AML.METHODSThis is a phase II study investigating the combination of venetoclax and CLAD/LDAC alternating with venetoclax and 5-AZA in older (≥ 60 years) or unfit patients with newly diagnosed AML. The primary objective was composite complete response (CR) rate (CR plus CR with incomplete blood count recovery); secondary end points were overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS), overall response rate, and toxicity.RESULTSA total of 60 patients were treated; median age was 68 years (range, 57-84 years). By European LeukemiaNet, 23%, 33%, and 43% were favorable, intermediate, and adverse risk, respectively. Fifty-six of 60 evaluable patients responded (composite CR: 93%) and 84% were negative for measurable residual disease. There was one death (2%) within 4 weeks. With a median follow-up of 22.1 months, the median overall survival and DFS have not yet been reached. The most frequent grade 3/4 nonhematologic adverse events were febrile neutropenia (n = 33) and pneumonia (n = 14). One patient developed grade 4 tumor lysis syndrome.CONCLUSIONVenetoclax and CLAD/LDAC alternating with venetoclax and 5-AZA is an effective regimen among older or unfit patients with newly diagnosed AML. The rates of overall survival and DFS are encouraging. Further study of this non-anthracycline-containing backbone in younger patients, unfit for intensive chemotherapy, as well as comparisons to standard frontline therapies is warranted.</td>

Previous studies have reported an association between the p.Val174Ala missense variant in SLCO1B1 and SAMS in simvastatin-treated subjects; however, evidence for genetic predictors of SAMS in atorvastatin- or rosuvastatin-treated subjects is currently lacking. Methods: ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab; n=18 924) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of alirocumab (a PCSK9 [proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9] inhibitor) in acute coronary syndrome patients receiving high-intensity statin therapy. The goal of this pharmacogenomic analysis was to identify genetic variants associated with atorvastatin- and rosuvastatin-mediated SAMS among ODYSSEY OUTCOMES subjects who consented to participate in the genetic study (n=11 880). We performed multi-ancestry exome-wide and genome-wide association studies and gene burden analysis across 2 phenotypes (clinical SAMS [n=10 617] and creatine kinase levels [n=9630]). Results: A novel genome-wide significant association for an intronic variant (rs6667912) located within TMEM9 (odds ratio [95% CI], 1.39 [1.24-1.55]; P=3.71×10(-8)) for patients with clinical SAMS (cases=894, controls=9723) was identified. This variant is located ≈30 kb upstream of CACNA1S, a locus associated with severe SAMS. We replicated 2 loci, at LINC0093 and LILRB5, previously associated with creatine kinase levels during statin treatment. No association was observed between p.Val174Ala (rs4149056) in SLCO1B1 and SAMS (odds ratio [95% CI], 1.03 [0.90-1.18]; P=0.69). Conclusions: This study comprises the largest discovery exome-wide and genome-wide association study for atorvastatin- or rosuvastatin-mediated SAMS to date. These novel genetic findings may provide biological/mechanistic insight into this drug-induced toxicity, and help identify at-risk patients before selection of lipid-lowering therapies.</td>

      <td>Dopamine (DA, 3-hydroxytyramine) is a member of the catecholamine family and is classically characterized according to its role in the central nervous system as a neurotransmitter. In recent decades, many novel and intriguing discoveries have been made about the peripheral expression of DA receptors (DRs) and the role of DA signaling in both normal and pathological processes. Drawing from decades of evidence suggesting a link between DA and cancer, the DA pathway has recently emerged as a potential target in antitumor therapies. Due to the onerous, expensive and frequently unsuccessful nature of drug development, the repurposing of dopaminergic drugs for cancer therapy has the potential to greatly benefit patients and drug developers alike. However, the lack of clear mechanistic data supporting the direct involvement of DRs and their downstream signaling components in cancer represents an ongoing challenge that has limited the translation of these drugs to the clinic. Despite this, the breadth of evidence linking DA to cancer and non-Tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment justifies further inquiry into the potential applications of this treatment modality in cancer. Herein, we review the literature characterizing the interplay between the DA signaling axis and cancer, highlighting key findings, and then propose rational lines of investigation to follow.</td>

Methods: A retrospective French nationwide study was conducted in patients with AAV who received RTX/MTX combination therapy for persistently active disease. Results: Seventeen patients were included. All patients had granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), with positive ANCA in 76% of them, mainly with PR3-ANCA specificity. Sixteen patients (94%) had priorly failed to achieve remission with RTX and 11 (65%) with CYC. Patients had experienced a median of 3 (2-4) flares. Manifestations requiring RTX/MTX combination therapy were subglottic or bronchial stenosis in 6 patients (35%), orbital mass in 6 (35%), disabling ENT involvement in 2 (12%), and epiduritis and pachymeningitis in 1 case (6%) each. The median follow-up duration for the RTX/MTX combination therapy was 11 months (11-26 months). At 6 months, global response had been achieved in 15 patients (88%), including partial response in 11 (65%) and complete response in 4 (24%). At last evaluation, global response had been achieved in 16 patients (94%). Seven patients (41%) experienced severe adverse events (grade 3 or 4), including infections in 4 (24%) and hepatitis in 2 (12%). Combination therapy was withdrawn in 4 patients (24%), but never for safety concerns. In contrast, the MTX dose was decreased in 2 patients (12%) because of adverse events.

      <td>Background: Historically, antimicrobial resistance has been rare in US invasive meningococcal disease cases. Methods: Meningococcal isolates (n=695) were collected through population-based surveillance, 2012-2016, and national surveillance, 2015-2016. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by broth microdilution. Resistance mechanisms were characterized using whole-genome sequencing. Results: All isolates were susceptible to 6 antibiotics (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, meropenem, rifampin, minocycline, and azithromycin). Approximately 25% were penicillin or ampicillin intermediate; among these, 79% contained mosaic penA gene mutations. Less than 1% of isolates were penicillin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin resistant. Conclusions: Penicillin-and ampicillin-intermediate isolates were common, but resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics remained rare.</td>

      <td>Failed Eradication Therapy of New-Onset Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infections in Children with Cystic Fibrosis Is Associated with Bacterial Resistance to Neutrophil Functions</td>
      <td>Background: Antibiotics, such as inhaled tobramycin, are used to eradicate new-onset Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) but frequently fail due to reasons poorly understood. We hypothesized that PA isolates' resistance to neutrophil antibacterial functions was associated with failed eradication in patients harboring those strains. Methods: We analyzed all PA isolates from a cohort of 39 CF children with new-onset PA infections undergoing tobramycin eradication therapy, where 30 patients had eradicated and 9 patients had persistent infection. We characterized several bacterial phenotypes and measured the isolates' susceptibility to neutrophil antibacterial functions using in vitro assays of phagocytosis and intracellular bacterial killing. Results: PA isolates from persistent infections were more resistant to neutrophil functions, with lower phagocytosis and intracellular bacterial killing compared to those from eradicated infections. In multivariable analyses, in vitro neutrophil responses were positively associated with twitching motility, and negatively with mucoidy. In vitro neutrophil phagocytosis was a predictor of persistent infection following tobramycin even after adjustment for clinical risk factors. Conclusions: PA isolates from new-onset CF infection show strain-specific susceptibility to neutrophil antibacterial functions, and infection with PA isolates resistant to neutrophil phagocytosis is an independent risk factor for failed tobramycin eradication.</td>

Methods: A total of 205 and 111 HBeAg-positive patients without cirrhosis who had stopped ETV or TDF treatment, respectively, for at least 6 months were recruited. Results: In the entire cohort, patients with HBeAg seroconversion during treatment, and propensity score-matched patients, those who discontinued TDF had significantly higher rates of virological and clinical relapse than patients who discontinued ETV therapy. Multivariate analysis identified that TDF was independently associated with virological and clinical relapse in the entire cohort and subgroup analysis. Patients with HBeAg loss without anti-HBe antibody formation during treatment had significantly higher rates of off-Therapy HBV relapse and HBeAg seroreversion than patients with HBeAg seroconversion during treatment. The hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) level at end of treatment (EOT) was independently associated with HBV relapse and HBeAg seroreversion in all patients and patients with HBeAg seroconversion during treatment.

      <td>Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Dementia: Considering a Clinical Role for Electroencephalography</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: Degenerative dementia is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, show synaptic loss and disruption of functional brain networks along with neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Electroencephalography (EEG) directly reflects synaptic activity, and among patients with AD it is associated with slowing of background activity. The purpose of this study was to identify associations between neuropsychiatric symptoms and EEG in patients with dementia and to determine whether EEG parameters could be used for clinical assessment of pharmacological treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia (NPSD) with galantamine or risperidone. METHODS: Seventy-two patients with EEG recordings and a score ≥10 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were included. Clinical assessments included administration of the NPI, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Patients underwent EEG examinations at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment with galantamine or risperidone. EEG frequency analysis was performed. Correlations between EEG and assessment scale scores were statistically examined, as were EEG changes from baseline to the week 12 visit and the relationship with NPI, CMAI, and MMSE scores. RESULTS: Significant correlations were found between NPI agitation and delta EEG frequencies at baseline and week 12. No other consistent and significant relationships were observed between NPSD and EEG at baseline, after NPSD treatment, or in the change in EEG from baseline to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The limited informative findings in this study suggest that there exists a complex relationship between NPSD and EEG; hence, it is difficult to evaluate and use EEG for clinical assessment of pharmacological NPSD treatment.</td>

      <td>Background: Infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria such as Acinetobacter baumannii are major cause of morbidity and mortality. Colistin is used commonly to treat these infections. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of different colistin combinations in a A. baumannii infection mouse model. Materials &amp; methods: An A. baumannii mouse infection model was developed in 150 experimental animals. Treatment groups were as follows: colistin, colistin + rifampicin, colistin + trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, colistin + teicoplanin and a control group. The outcome was bacterial burden in the lung and liver tissues. The treatment groups were subdivided into 24-, 48- and 72-h groups. Results: Colistin and combinations reduce the A. baumannii burden significantly in lung and liver tissues compared with the control group. Compared with colistin alone colistin + rifampicin and colistin + TMP-SMX provided significantly better reduction in the bacterial burden. Conclusion: These results may suggest that rifampicin and TMP-SMX combination with colistin may have a potential role in the treatment of A. baumannii infections.</td>

Here the authors review previous studies on bacteriocins that have been effectively employed to manage MRSA infections. The authors' review focuses on the beneficial traits of bacteriocins for further application as templates for the design of novel drugs. Treatments that combine bacteriocins with other antimicrobials to combat pervasive MRSA infections are also highlighted. In short, future studies should focus on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of bacteriocins-antimicrobials to understand their interactions, as this aspect would likely determine their efficacy in MRSA inhibition.</td>

Baseline pre-ART values were compared with those from ART-naive HIV-monoinfected and HIV-seronegative individuals. Before ART, HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals had higher levels of neopterin, sCD14, and sCD163, and increased frequencies of CD38+HLA-DR+, PD1+, and TIGIT+ CD4 and CD8 T cells compared with ART-naive HIV-monoinfected or HIV-seronegative individuals (all p &lt; .01). Most parameters did not normalize despite 72 weeks of ART. In particular sCD163 persisted at high levels. Improvement over 72 weeks in fibrosis as assessed by FibroScan® correlated with reductions in plasma sCD163 and in the frequencies of T cell activation, single PD1+, TIGIT+, and dual PD1+TIGIT+ CD8 T cells. A nonsignificant tendency toward more favorable effects on monocyte and T cell immune activation and on T cell exhaustion were seen with RAL-compared with EFV-based therapy. The initiation of ART in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals is associated with incomplete improvement in monocyte and T cell immune activation and exhaustion, which was associated with some corresponding improvement in liver fibrosis.</td>

Plasma samples were collected from HIV-1-positive individuals who experienced ART failure in Liaoning Province between April 2018 and September 2019. Genotype resistance test was performed using an in-house assay on these collected samples. Factors associated with drug resistance were identified by logistic regression analysis. We collected a total of 468 ART-failure individuals, of which 256 were successfully included in the final study. Of these, the most predominant genotype was CRF01-AE, accounting for 77.73%. The resistance rate to any of the three classes of antiretroviral drugs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs], nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs], and protease inhibitors [PIs]) was 64.84%. Among 256 ART-failure patients, 62.89% showed drug resistance to NNRTIs, 50.39% to NRTIs, and 3.13% to PIs. G190S (31.25%) and Y181C (25.78%) mutations were the most common NNRTIs resistance mutations. K65R (29.69%), M184V (28.52%) were the most common NRTIs resistance mutations. Factors associated with drug resistance included current ART regimen and viral load. The high drug resistance rate among ART-failure individuals in Liaoning Province needs more attention. Corresponding strategies for the risk factors associated with HIV drug resistance can better control and prevent the prevalence of resistance.</td>

We describe temporal trends in outcomes for children and adolescents initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) from 2004 to 2014 at sites supported by Centre for Health Solutions-Kenya, in central Kenya. We retrospectively analyzed data from children 0-9 years of age (n = 3,519) and adolescents 10-19 years of age (n = 1,663) living with HIV, who newly initiated ART at 47 health facilities in central Kenya. Year cohorts were analyzed from the Comprehensive Patient Application Database (CPAD) and International Quality Care (IQCare) electronic medical databases, including temporal trends in outcomes and associated factors using multivariable competing risk regression analysis. There were more girls (2,453 [52.7%]) than boys, with most enrolled at World Health Organization (WHO) stage II (1,813 [37.7%]) or III disease (1,694 [35.1%]). Most of the children and adolescents (4,431 [96.4%]) did not have tuberculosis (TB) symptoms. Cumulative lost to follow-up (LTFU) incidence at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months were 5.0%, 9.9%, 22.9%, and 33.1%, respectively. Cumulative mortality incidence at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months were 0.7%, 1.0%, 1.2%, and 1.5%, respectively. The incidence of LTFU was higher among female children and adolescents, those initiated on tenofovir-based regimens, and those with presumptive TB symptoms. Mortality risk was higher among those with WHO stage III or IV disease, and children and adolescents on TB treatment or who had presumptive TB. Enrollment occurred at a young age and pediatric-friendly ART regimens were initiated at earlier WHO stages implying effective early infant diagnosis and treatment for all strategies, resulting in improved treatment outcomes. The higher retention rates in recent years as well as the lower retention after many years of follow-up underscore the importance of implementing longitudinal follow-up strategies targeting this population.</td>

A low-cost lateral flow urine tenofovir (TFV) rapid assay predicts pre-exposure prophylaxis breakthroughs, but has not yet been investigated in HIV treatment. We therefore evaluated its utility in a pilot cross-sectional study of TFV-containing ART recipients at an increased risk of virologic failure (VF). Participants who had a treatment interruption ≥30 days or had ≥1 episode of viremia (VL ≥400 copies/mL) in the previous year were recruited from a public health setting in Cape Town, South Africa. Self-reported adherence data were collected, the urine TFV assay performed, and concurrent TFV-diphosphate analyzed in dried blood spots. VL testing was done concurrently and, if viremic, genotypic HIV drug resistance testing was performed. Of 48 participants, 18 (37.5%) had VL (&gt;400 copies/mL) at the time of the study, including 16 of 39 receiving efavirenz (EFV), 2 of 6 receiving protease inhibitors, and 0 of 3 receiving dolutegravir. Resistance testing succeeded in 17/18, of which 14 had significant mutations compromising ≥2 agents of the current EFV-based regimen. Of these 14, all had detected urine TFV. Urine TFV was undetectable in two out of three without regimen-relevant resistance; p = .02. In participants on EFV-based regimens returning to care, VF was largely due to viral resistance, where detectable urine TFV had 100% sensitivity (14/14 participants) in predicting resistance. Conversely, when undetectable, the urine-based assay could be used to preclude participants with poor adherence from undergoing costly HIV drug resistance testing.</td>

      <td>Prevalence of Antimicrobial Resistant and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-producing Escherichia coli in Dairy Cattle Farms in East Tennessee</td>
      <td>Antimicrobials have been widely used in dairy farms to prevent and control dairy cattle diseases since 1960s. This led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB) that, along with their antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), can spread from dairy farms to humans. Therefore, regular antimicrobial resistance (AMR) monitoring is important to implement proper mitigation measures. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of AMR and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Escherichia coli in dairy cattle. A cross-sectional study was conducted in four dairy cattle farms (A-D) in East Tennessee. A total of 80 samples consisting of 20 samples each of bulk tank milk, feces, dairy cattle manure-amended soil, and prairie soil adjacent to the farms were collected and cultured for the isolation of E. coli. Tetracycline (TETr)-, third-generation cephalosporin (TGCr)-and nalidixic acid (NALr)-resistant E. coli (n = 88) were isolated and identified on agar media supplemented with TET, cefotaxime, and NAL, respectively. TGCr E. coli were tested for ESBLs and other coselected ARGs. TETr (74%, n = 88) was the most common, followed by TGCr (20%) and NALr (8%). Farms had significant (p &lt; 0.001) differences: the highest prevalence of TGCr (55%) and TETr (100%) were observed in farm D, while all NALr isolates were from farm C. Over 83% of TGCr isolates (n = 18) harbored ESBL gene blaCTX-M. Majority (78%) of the E. coli isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR), being positive for beta-lactams (blaCTX-M), TETs tet(A), tet(B), tet(M)), sulfonamides (sul2), aminoglycosides (strA), and phenicols (floR). This study indicated the widespread occurrence of MDR ESBLs-E. coli in dairy cattle farms. AMR surveillance of more dairy farms and identification of farm-level risk factors are important to mitigate the occurrence and spread of ARB of significant public health importance, such as ESBLs-E. coli.</td>

Colchicine has an important role in inhibiting activation of NLRP3 inflammasome that predispose to decrease cytokine production. This study aimed to evaluate whether colchicine is effective in treatment of corona virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients or not. Patients and Methods: A randomized, open-labeled, clinical trial of Colchicine for the treatment of COVID-19, allocated between May 8, and June 18, 2021. The colchicine tablet dosage was 0.5 mg twice daily for 14 days added to the standard treatment versus control group who receive standard treatment without colchicine, with the trial registration ID: NCT04867226. The study was conducted in Erbil city-Iraq with the endpoints being clinical, laboratory parameters and duration of hospitalization. Results: Eighty patients participated in the study. Fewer patients in the colchicine group had musculoskeletal symptoms (17.5%, P = 0.001) in comparison to the patients, who received control treatment. The serum ferritin level in most of patients who treated with colchicine returned to normal in contrast to the control group, whose serum ferritin level was still high (P = 0.041). Similarly, the average of C-reactive protein and D-dimer after treatment among the colchicine group participants was significantly lower than the control group, the P values were 0.011 and 0.043 consecutively. The colchicine group patients stayed for a shorter duration at the hospital (18.4 days) compared to the control group (24.24 days). P value was 0.009. In addition to that the response and cure rate were higher in the colchicine group (56%) in the comparison to control group (43.1%). Conclusion: The colchicine drug can be effective in treating patients with COVID-19 infection by improving musculoskeletal symptoms and inhibiting inflammatory biomarkers; it is also effective in reducing duration of hospitalization.</td>

      <td>The Loss of the Lysine Acetyltransferase KAT8 in Adipocytes Confers Lipodystrophy and Metabolic Dysfunction in Male and Female Mice</td>
      <td>KAT8, also known as MOF or MYST1, is a lysine acetyltransferase with both histone and nonhistone substrates. While KAT8 is the major H4K16 acetyltransferase in Drosophila and mammals and is essential for embryonic development, its role in specific cell types is not well understood. Moreover, studies within the past decade have demonstrated lineage-, differentiation state-, or stress-dependent roles of KAT8. Our recent efforts have shown that KAT8 is necessary for in vitro adipogenesis prior to or during the proliferative phase. Notably, several, independent genetic studies reveal that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or near the KAT8 gene are associated with body mass index and/or waist circumference. To investigate the role of KAT8 in differentiated adipocytes and to understand the contribution of KAT8-deficient adipocytes to wholebody glucose and lipid metabolism, we generated both congenital and doxycycline-inducible adipocyte-specific knockout mice, in which Kat8 gene deletion occurs only in adiponectinexpressing cells. Adult mice lacking adipocyte KAT8 exhibited significant fat mass loss with no change in lean mass. While the size of inguinal and brown adipose tissue was significantly reduced in both sexes fed either chow or high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet, male mice also had decreased gonadal, retroperitoneal, and mesenteric depots. Histological assessments revealed substantial remodeling within adipose tissue depots, and these mice demonstrated reduced insulin sensitivity and increased lipid accumulation in the liver when fed HFHS diet. Although further investigation is necessary to identify KAT8 targets that confer lipodystrophy, these studies are the first to show the impact of the loss of adipocyte KAT8 in vivo.</td>

      <td>The Antipsychotic D2 Receptor Antagonist Diphenylbutylpiperidines Improve Glycemia in Experimental Obesity by Inhibiting Succinyl-CoA-3-Ketoacid CoA transferase</td>
      <td>Purpose: Despite significant progress in understanding the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) , it remains difficult to manage, hence, new therapeutic options are required. We previously observed that elevated skeletal muscle succinyl CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) activity, the ratelimiting enzyme of ketone (KB) oxidation, contributes to obesity-induced hyperglycemia. Moreover, we identified that the antipsychotic agent, pimozide, is a SCOT inhibitor with glucose-lowering actions. In silico molecular modeling determined that a wide range of DPBPs can theoretically inhibit SCOT activity, therefore, we determined whether the DPBP drug class could be repurposed for the treatment of T2D. Methods: 8-week-old male wild-type and muscle-specific/brain-specific SCOT knockout (SCOTMuscleKO, SCOTBrainKO) mice were subjected to experimental obesity via consumption of a high fat, high sugar diet for 12-weeks. Lean control mice received a low fat, low sugar diet. At 8-weeks, lean and obese mice were treated with DPBPs (penfluridol, fluspirilene, pimozide (10mg/kg)) once every 2 days via oral gavage for 14-days, following which circulating KB levels and glucose homeostasis were assessed. To rule out a contribution of the canonical actions of DPBPs as dopamine 2 (D2 ) receptor antagonists to DPBP-mediated glucose-lowering, obese mice were treated with the structurally unrelated D2 receptor antagonist, lurasidone (10 mg/kg) . Results: All tested DPBPs improved glucose homeostasis in obese mice through a mechanism dependent on the inhibition of both brain and muscle SCOT activity. Treatment with lurasidone failed to improve glycemia in obese mice, thus consistent with a SCOT-dependent mechanism of action. Conclusions: Our findings suggest all DPBPs have glucose-lowering actions and therefore may have clinical utility in being repurposed for the treatment of T2D.</td>

      <td>Real-Time In Vivo Analysis of Beta-Cell Autophagy in Autoimmune Diabetes</td>
      <td>Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The onset of disease is associated with autoimmune attack against pancreatic beta-cells leading to a reduction of their number. While a role for the beta-cell in these events is widely hypothesized, a complete understanding of disease pathogenesis is still lacking. Our group recently found that beta-cell autophagy is defective in the context of human T1D as well as in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of autoimmune diabetes. Importantly, our data suggested that defective autophagy is present prior to the onset of diabetes but stopped short of definitively demonstrating pre-existing defects. Therefore, here we evaluated autophagic flux in the pancreatic beta-cells of live mice using a fluorescent biosensor coupled to intravital microscopy. A custom beta-cell-selective autophagy biosensor (AAV8-INS-mCherry-EGFP-LC3B) was intraperitoneally (IP) injected into 7-week-old mice of three strains: wild type C57Bl/6J, NOD and NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. Three weeks after biosensor injections, mice were placed under inhaled isoflurane anesthesia, then externalized pancreata were imaged using a LEICA SP8 DIVE two-photon microscope mounted with a 40x/1.1NA water objective. To evaluate autophagic flux, we assessed fluorescent signal over time in response to IP infusion of either saline or chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor. Autophagic flux was assessed by quantifying the rate of change of the ph-sensitive GFP and the ph-insensitive RFP, as well as signal colocalization. In wild type mice, we observed clear evidence of autophagic flux over time that was altered in the presence of chloroquine. However, in contrast, in pre-diabetic NOD mice, islet autophagic flux did not respond effectively to chloroquine treatment. Collectively, these data support the conclusion that autophagy defects precede hyperglycemia and suggest a potential role for these defects in beta cell demise during T1D pathogenesis.</td>

      <td>Loss of the Transcription Factor Tcf21 in Adult Podocytes Leads to Susceptibility in Diabetic Kidney Disease</td>
      <td>Background: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of dialysis induction in the United States. Tcf21 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is essential for the development of the lungs, heart, and kidneys. Previously, we reported that Tcf21 regulates podocyte development. However, the precise role of Tcf21 in mature individuals and DKD remains unclear. Method: We generated mice that lacked Tcf21 only in podocytes after birth (iKO) using a doxycycline induction system. We also constructed a diabetes mouse model using streptozotocin injections. In addition, we used cultured human podocytes to investigate the effects of Tcf21 overexpression and the factors that regulate Tcf21 expression. Results: When the Tcf21 gene was deleted specifically in podocytes in 3-week-old mice, urinary protein was not observed. In contrast, when diabetes was induced in these mice, massive urinary protein and strong glomerulosclerosis was present in 60% of iKO mice. Ultrastructural analysis revealed glomerular basement membrane thickening and podocyte foot process effacement, suggesting that iKO mice are susceptible to DKD. In addition, RNA-seq analysis of Tcf21- overexpressing podocytes showed accumulation of genes involved in the interferon pathway, extracellular matrix production, senescence, and autophagy in gene ontology analysis. Analysis of individual genes showed upregulation of interferon-related genes such as IFI6 and IFI27, increased expression of PAI-1, which is one of the senescence-associated secreted phenotypes, and decreased expression of HMGA2, whose SNIP is known to correlate with susceptibility to DKD. In addition, Tcf21 expression was suppressed by 58% and 27% after TGF-β and high glucose plus insulin stimulation, respectively. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Tcf21 protects against DKD in mature individuals. Elucidation of the mechanism by which Tcf21 prevents DKD may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets.</td>

      <td>Elucidation and pharmacological targeting of master regulator proteins representing mechanistic determinants of breast cancer stem-like tumor initiating cell state</td>
      <td>Although breast cancer Stem-Like Tumor Initiating Cells (SLTIC) represent only a minute fraction of the total tumor mass, they are resistant to standard of care treatment and play a key role in tumor initiation, maintenance, and progression. Unequivocal SLTIC isolation, using surface markers, has proven highly elusive, thus impeding characterization and targeting of their mechanistic dependencies. To address this challenge, we applied a systems biology approach to effectively characterize SLTIC biology and to prioritize drugs that can reprogram them to a more differentiated state that is sensitive to chemotherapy. To isolate breast cancer cells enriched for SLTICs, we performed flow cytometry-based sorting of tumor cells from 7 metastatic breast cancer patients, based on the expression of Epcam and CD49F, which are established epithelial and SLTIC-enriched cell markers, respectively. Activitybased clustering of single cell RNASeq profiles using the VIPER (Alvarez et al. Nat Genet 2017) algorithm identified two cell states, comprising cells presenting high activity of either SLTIC (i.e., BMI1, NOTCH1, etc.) or differentiated, proliferative epithelial cell markers (i.e., PCNA, CCNB1, etc.). Analysis of RNASeq profiles of BT20 cells treated with ∼400 FDA approved and late-stage experimental drugs identified albendazole as the drug inducing the most significant activity inversion of SLTIC Master Regulator proteins (Alvarez et al. Nat Genet 2018) (p=4.21x10-5). This was experimentally confirmed in vivo by single cell analysis of metastatic TNBC PDX models at 14 days after treatment with albendazole, paclitaxel (a drug known to kill differentiated but not SLTIC cells), and vehicle control. As expected, paclitaxel induced dramatic decrease of the differentiated vs. SLTIC cell ratio, while albendazole had the opposite effect, inducing equally dramatic increase in that ratio, as assessed by a combination of CytoTRACE and established SLTIC marker analysis. Sequential therapy, based on a 30-day treatment with albendazole with 3 rounds of paclitaxel at day 15, 22, and 30, repeated after a 15-day drug holiday produced highly synergistic tumor volume reduction, compared to individual monotherapies (p=0.00869 by Bliss independence analysis). Indeed, while albendazole had little effect compared to vehicle control, as monotherapy, it induced &gt;50% additional tumor viability reduction when combined with paclitaxel. The approach is highly generalizable and can be used to identify potential combination therapy approaches for any tumor in which molecular distinct subpopulations co-exist with different drug sensitivities, thus offering a practical solution to addressing tumor heterogeneity.</td>

      <td>TWIST2 promotes tumor progression and represses myogenic differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma</td>
      <td>Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is an aggressive pediatric soft tissue sarcoma of myoblast origin. RMS tumors are unable to terminally differentiate into syncytial muscle despite elevated expression of the muscle master regulators, MyoD and Myf5. Fusion-positive RMS (FP-RMS) and fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS) have emerged as the two major RMS subtypes. The pathogenesis of FP-RMS is commonly defined by the balanced translocation of chromosomes 2 and 3 resulting in the misexpression of a chimeric PAX3/7-FOXO1 oncoprotein that derails normal differentiation pathways. However, the molecular basis of FN-RMS is poorly understood as single nucleotide variations in genes like KRAS, NRAS, and TP53 have limited recurrence (less than 10% of all patient tumors). In contrast, DNA copy number variations are highly recurrent and the genes they encode represent vulnerabilities in FN-RMS. Strikingly, we discovered that 72% of FN-RMS patient tumors harbor copy number amplifications at loci of TWIST1, TWIST2, or both, resulting in the upregulation of TWIST gene expression. We demonstrated that depletion of TWIST2 using a doxycycline inducible shRNA system caused cell cycle arrest and increased myogenic differentiation in xenograft models of FN-RMS. To interrogate whether TWIST2 can directly regulate the expression of these genes, we performed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq for TWIST2, H3K27Ac, and MYOD in TWIST2 knockdown and control FN-RMS cells. Utilizing this genome-wide data of chromatin binding, we comprehensively demonstrated that TWIST2 competes with MYOD preferentially at a subset of enhancers required for myogenic differentiation, causing repression of these loci. Interestingly, while MYOD binding is gained at myogenic loci in the absence of TWIST2, binding of MYOD is not lost at growth-promoting, oncogenic enhancers despite a decrease in their associated gene expression. This suggests that TWIST2 interacts with a different slew of transcription factors or chromatin regulators to activate gene expression. To interrogate this possibility, we are characterizing the TWIST2 protein interactome in FN-RMS cells using BioID as well as motifs enriched at TWIST2-regulated peaks. By studying TWIST2-associated pathways that affect RMS growth and differentiation, we see an opportunity to unlock novel therapeutic strategies for RMS.</td>

      <td>Currently, the role of autophagy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is not fully understood however it has been linked to drug resistance. Several autophagy modulators have proven their efficacy in single agents or as chemo-sensitizer in ALL. Recently, the 3rd generation BCR-ABL1 inhibitor, ponatinib, has been showed to promote autophagy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells and the combination between ponatinib and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has proven its efficacy in neuroblastoma cells. Here, we tested the efficacy of combining different autophagy modulators (ponatinib, HCQ and rapamycin) against ALL cell lines and primary leukemic ALL cells. Firstly, we established the IC50 values of a panel of Philadelphia (Ph)-positive/negative B-/T-ALL cell lines (n=6) treated with ponatinib, HCQ and rapamycin in single agent. Then, using sub-toxic concentrations, we evaluated the efficacy of the combinations HCQ+Ponatinib and HCQ+Rapamycin in the reduction of the cell viability after 24, 48 and 72 hours of simultaneous treatment. Combination index analyses showed a synergic time and dosage-dependent reduction of the cell viability in all the cell lines treated with HCQ+Ponatinib. The combination HCQ+Rapamycin resulted synergic only in Ph-negative ALL cell lines. These results were confirmed by the significant induction of apoptosis (Annexin V and/or Caspase-3 staining) in the samples treated with HCQ+Ponatinib. The two combinations also significantly reduced the proliferation capacity of ALL cell lines in comparison with controls and single treatments. Moreover, the efficacy of the two combinations was confirmed on primary leukemic blasts isolated form adult ALL patients(n=6). Indeed, a significant induction of apoptosis was seen in samples treated with the two combinations in comparison with single treatments. To deeper understand the mechanism of action of the combinations we evaluated LC3A/B expression by flow cytometry. Interestingly, the expression of LC3A/B was modified heterogeneously among the different ALL cell lines and did not correlate with the response in term of cell viability or induction of apoptosis. Light microscopy analyses showed a significant increment in the number and diameter of autophagy vesicles in both ALL cell lines and primary leukemic ALL cells treated with HCQ+Ponatinib in comparison with single treatments. Interstingly, no significant effect on autophagy vesicles number or diameter was seen in the samples treated with HCQ+Rapamycin in comparison with single treatments. In conclusion, our findings show that the identified combinations effectively inhibit cell viability and induce apoptosis in Ph-positive/negative B-/T-ALL cells, suggesting the fundamental role of autophagy regulation in ALL survival.</td>

      <td>Targeting metabolic pathways through pharmacological and chemotherapeutic interventions to improve triple-negative breast cancer therapy</td>
      <td>Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) lack targeted therapies, leaving surgery and systemic chemotherapy as current standard approaches for treatment. However, chemotherapy resistance is a major clinical challenge. Stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) activates the protein kinase A (PKA), mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascades. Activation of these pathways is observed in the majority of TNBC tumors and promotes pro-proliferative signaling. Thus IGF-1R/IR are potential therapeutic targets in TNBC, but clinical trials of anti-IGF-1R/IR therapies have consistently shown minimal and often heterogeneous therapeutic responses. Our objective was to determine whether metabolic reprogramming achieved by combination regimens, specifically the IGF-1R/IR inhibitor BMS-754807 and/or treatment with the platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent, carboplatin, promotes autophagy induction and sensitizes cancer cells to autophagy inhibition. Cytotoxicity of BMS754807, alone or in combination with carboplatin and/or the autophagy inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine, was assessed in murine (E0771, metM-Wntlung, B6C3TAg 2.51) and human (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468) models of TNBC using MTT assays. Analysis of mitochondrial mass was measured in cells stained with MitoTracker Green FM using flow cytometry. Autophagic flux was measured with an mCherry-EGFP-LC3B tandem fluorescent protein. BMS-754807 (10μM) significantly induced 22-51% cytotoxicity in all cell lines tested, with E0771 cells showing the strongest response. Treatment with BMS-754807 (2.5μM) significantly increased mitochondrial mass (31%) compared to untreated cells. In addition, co-treatment with BMS-754807 and carboplatin further suppressed cell viability and regulated phosphorylation of the double-stranded DNA damage response proteins γ;-H2AX and Chk2. Co-treatment with BMS-754807 and carboplatin also altered the GFP/RFP ratio in LC3-expressing cells, suggesting modulation of autophagic flux. Finally, the addition of the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine further induced cytotoxicity when coupled with BMS-754807 and carboplatin. This work indicates that IGF-1R/IR inhibition remodels metabolism in TNBC cells, potentially synergizing with carboplatin to induce double stranded DNA damage. Moreover, the combination of IGF-1R/IR and carboplatin can further collaborate with autophagy inhibition to strongly suppress TNBC cell growth. We conclude that inhibiting nutrient-sensing metabolic pathways such as IGF-1R/IR in combination with chemotherapy and/or autophagy inhibition warrants additional study as a strategy to improve therapeutic responses in women with TNBC.</td>

      <td>HER2 is amplified in about 20% of breast cancers. HER3 is as essential as HER2 for maintaining cell viability in HER2+ breast cancer cells. It is known that inhibition of HER2 tyrosine kinase activity results in upregulation of HER3 transcription and phosphorylation. We sought to identify HER3 binding partners upon pharmacological inhibition of HER2 using neratinib. We immunoprecipitated HER3 using a HER3 antibody from BT474 cells treated ± neratinib. Fmass spectrometry experiments identified non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) increased upon inhibition of HER2 with neratinib and decreased under DMSO control treatment from HER3 immunoprecipitates. To validate the presence of NMIIA, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments in BT474 and MDA-MB-453 cells using a HER3 antibody. Immunoblots showed increased NMIIA levels upon treatment with 200nM neratinib for 24 hours in both cell lines. Myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9) gene encodes a protein called non-muscle myosin of class II, isoform A (NMIIA). It localizes to actin stress fibers and has been implicated in many cell functions. To confirm the interaction between HER3 and NMIIA we immunoprecipitated NMIIA from BT474 and MDA-MB-453 cells using a NMIIA antibody. Immunoblots indicated that HER3 levels were increased upon inhibition of HER2 with 200 nM neratinib for 24 hours. We next examined overall survival of primary breast cancer patients who have high gene expression for MYH9 from the METABRIC cohort. We observed that patients with high levels of MYH9 have a statistically significant worse overall survival versus patients with low levels of MYH9. Furthermore, we evaluated the overall levels of HER3 and MYH9 mRNA and protein upon treatment with neratinib in BT474 and MDA-MB-453 whole cell lysates. RT-qPCR and immunoblots showed increased HER3 and NM-IIA mRNA and protein levels upon neratinib treatment for 24 hours We examined the affect NMIIA loss has on HER3 signaling. Transduced MDA-MB-453 and BT474 cells with shMYH9 and doxycycline induction demonstrate a reduction in HER3 protein levels compared to cells transduced with a control sequence and doxycycline induction. We observed a concomitant reduction in P-HER3 (Y1289), downstream P-Akt (T308), and P-Erk1/2. In addition, NM-IIA knockdown suppresses cells growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, there is a bidirectional relationship between NMIIA and HER signaling in HER2+ breast cancer cells. HER2 inhibition increases NMIIA and NMIIA promotes HER3 expression. Loss of NMIIA reduces HER3 protein and concomitant reductions in PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling. Loss of NMIIA in combination with HER2 inhibition results in reduction in HER2+ breast cancer cell proliferation, growth on matrigel, migration, and invasion. Studies are ongoing to decipher the mechanisms for the bidirectional relationship between NMIIA and HER signaling.</td>

      <td>EGFR upregulation in breast cancer cells: A key mechanism of escape from antiestrogen induced death, autophagy, and senescence</td>
      <td>EGFR is upregulated commonly in multiple cancer types, including breast cancer. However, the multiple role(s) of EGFR in breast cancer are not fully elucidated. In this study, we characterized a unique antiestrogen resistant breast cancer subline and provide compelling data that upregulation of the EGFR/MEK1/MAPK1/2 signaling axis during antiestrogen treatment facilitated escape from senescence, autophagy, and BimEL-dependent apoptosis. Our studies were conducted with the antiestrogen resistant TR5 cell line established by our laboratory, using a step-wise drug selection with the antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) of the estrogen receptor α (ER+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells. A preliminary microarray comparing mRNA expression between 4-OHT-selected TR5 cells and MCF-7 parent cells identified upregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Western blot showed a greater than 5-fold upregulation of EGFR expression and downregulation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) compared to the levels in MCF-7 and T47-D (antiestrogen sensitive). Selective inhibition of EGFR, phosphorylated at Tyr 1068, was achieved with erlotinib. Inhibition blocked MEK1/MAPK1/2 signaling, which was also upregulated in 4-OHT selected TR5 cells, with detectable increases in the pro-apoptotic BH3 protein BimEL, and a fifty percent reduction in cell viability. However, a high number of cells survived erlotinib therapy due to autophagy induction determined to be cytoprotective. Autophagy induction was identified by analyzing the expression/turnover of autophagy proteins LC3-II and p62, a standard approach to ascertain autophagy levels in cells. Further, erlotinib treatment induced a 2-fold increase in the number of senescent cells in the surviving population. Senescent cells were identified by β-galactosidase staining of erlotinib-treated cells utilizing confocal microscopy. Interestingly, blockade of autophagy with the lysosomotrophic compound chloroquine enhanced the senescence cell population, suggesting that either autophagy blocked senescence induction or lysosome impairment increased senescence. Mechanistically, we have identified phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK) as being elevated under conditions of erlotinib treatment, and reduced in 4-OHT-selected TR5 cells relative to MCF-7 parent cells. This correlation supports the hypothesis that pAMPK was downregulated during 4-OHT selection of TR5 cells by elevated EGFR/MEK/MAPK1/2 signaling to allow surviving cells escape senescence induction and/or anti-proliferative autophagy. Overall we propose that EGFR mediated downregulation of pAMPK is a major regulatory pathway in breast cancer cells surviving endocrine treatment. Our current studies are dissecting the role of EGFR-mediated AMPK regulation with somatic cell-based studies and pharmacological intervention.</td>

      <td>Natural killer cells mediate tumor-inhibitory functions of USP6 in Ewing sarcoma</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Understanding how Natural Killer (NK) cell activity is regulated by cancer cells is critical for developing NK-cell based immunotherapies. Our studies show that the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease-6 (USP6) can induce an immune-stimulatory hot tumor microenvironment in Ewing sarcoma (ES), the 2nd most common pediatric bone cancer. High USP6 expression in ES is associated with significantly improved overall and progression-free survival. We found that USP6 expression in ES cells inhibits xenograft growth in nude mice, but not NSG mice, implicating a role for the innate immune system, particularly cytotoxic NK cells. Notably, USP6 expression enhanced intra-tumoral abundance, activation, and proliferative capacity of NK cells. In vitro cytotoxicity assays confirm that USP6 can directly augment the ability of ES cells to activate NK cells. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that NK cells are essential for USP6- mediated tumor suppression and seek to determine the mechanism by which their cytolytic function is activated by USP6. METHOD: We used ES cell lines A673 and RD-ES expressing USP6 in a doxycycline (dox)- inducible manner, the immortalized human NK cell line NK-92, and primary human and mouse NK cells. Athymic nude or RAG2-/- mice were xenografted subcutaneously with ES cell lines and fed dox-infused water to induce USP6. Immune cell abundance and activation were monitored both in tumors and peripheral blood by flow cytometry. For in vivo depletion of NK cells, 300ug of antiNK1.1 (PK136) ab was injected i.p. into RAG2-/- mice one day prior to ES xenografting, then once weekly thereafter. RESULTS: USP6 induces in ES cells the surface expression of multiple NK activating ligands, as well as receptors for the apoptotic factor TRAIL (DR5) and Type I/II interferons (IFNAR1 and IFNGR1), both in vitro and in vivo. This leads to enhanced NK activation and renders ES cells hypersensitive to NK-mediated cytotoxicity. IFNy released by activated NK cells feeds back on the USP6-expressing ES cells, inducing synergistic expression of multiple IFNy-inducible genes, including chemokines CXCL9/10 (chemoattractants for NK cells) and ICAM-1 (essential for immunological synapse formation between NK cells and their targets). A potent feed forward loop for NK activation/ES cell killing is thus generated. Concordantly, in RAG2-/- mice, USP6 induces increased intratumoral infiltration and activation of NK cells, and also, strikingly, systemic activation of NK cells. Depletion of NK cells using anti-NK1.1(PK136) completely abrogates USP6-mediated inhibition of ES xenograft growth. CONCLUSION: NK cells are essential for mediating the tumor inhibitory functions of USP6 in ES. We posit that USP6's ability to activate NK cells both intratumorally and systemically underlies its association with improved ES patient prognosis, which we seek to exploit for therapeutic benefit in future studies.</td>

      <td>Inhibition of mitochondrial translation by the marine natural product elatol shows potent antileukemia activity</td>
      <td>Targeted signaling inhibitors for hematologic malignancies may lead to limited clinical efficacy due to the outgrowth of subpopulations with alternative pathways independent of the drug target. Recent studies have shown that some forms of hematologic malignancies (Ashton et al., 2018) and solid tumors (Molina et al., 2018) have an energy metabolism highly dependent on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Tigecycline, a US FDA approved antibiotic, has been shown to inhibit synthesis of mitochondrion-encoded proteins leading to selective lethality in hematologic malignancies reliant on oxidative phosphorylation (Norberg et al., 2017). Combination treatment with the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib and tigecycline eradicated therapy-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), both in vitro and in vivo (Kuntz et al., 2017). We have previously reported that elatol, the major compound from algae Laurencia microcladia, is effective against several non-Hodgkin lymphomas and primary CML cells (Peters et al., 2018). In vitro studies showed that elatol inhibits eIF4A1 helicase activity, suppressing cytoplasmic capdependent translation initiation. Further assessments using 35-S-methionine incorporation in HEK293T cells treated with single-digit micromolar concentrations of elatol for short periods revealed strong downregulation of mitochondrion-encoded proteins (no transcriptional effect). This was confirmed in CML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines whose 24-hour elatol LD50 ranged from high nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations. This potency was 2-10x higher than for tigecycline in side-by-side comparisons across several leukemia cell lines. Through sedimentation property analysis using sucrose gradients, we established that elatol does not affect integrity of small and large mitochondrial ribosomal units. Although the specific target on the mitochondrial translation apparatus remains elusive, we have uncovered that its mechanism of action differs from that of chloramphenicol, which inhibits translation elongation. Moreover, elatol treatment leads to activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) evidenced by induction of ATF4 and CHOP. We found that elatol activates the ISR through mitochondrial stress in which cleaved DELE1 binds to HRI to phosphorylate eIF2α, a mechanism described in Fessler et al., 2020. In summary, we have performed proof-of-concept studies using HEK293T and HeLa cell lines, isolated mitochondria, and CML and ALL cell lines to reveal that elatol is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis and mechanistically different from chloramphenicol. Tigecycline's compelling preclinical data in combination with TKI informed design of a pending clinical trial (NCT02883036). Elatol's greatly improved potency provides a potential starting point for further optimization of this paradigm.</td>

      <td>EHD1 is required for IGF1R-mediated oncogenic signaling in Ewing Sarcoma</td>
      <td>Background: Ewing Sarcoma (EWS) is the second most common malignant bone tumor of children and adolescents. Patients with metastatic or recurrent disease have very poor outcomes. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) has been implicated in EWS tumorigenesis and development of metastatic disease, with anti-IGF1R antibodies and kinase inhibitors in clinical studies. However, with only ∼10% of patients achieving objective responses, delineation of novel pathways that facilitate IGF1R-driven oncogenesis in EWS could provide avenues for more effective therapy. Intracellular trafficking plays a central role in regulating RTK expression and signaling, and this pathway is frequently deregulated in cancer cells. The EPS15 homology domain-containing (EHD) proteins regulate intracellular traffic of cell surface receptors, including RTKs. We observed high frequency (67%) of EHD1 overexpression in 266 primary EWS patient tumor tissues and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of publicly available mRNA expression data showed that high EHD1 expression was associated with shorter patient survival. Objective: This study aims to comprehend the underlying role of EHD1 in EWS oncogenesis. Study design: Three EHD1-expressing EWS cell lines, TC71, SKES1, and A673, were engineered with doxycycline-inducible EHD1 shRNAs to assess the impact of EHD1 knockdown (KD) on in vitro oncogenic properties. Stable EHD1-Crispr-KO and mouse EHD1-rescue TC71 and A673 cell line models were developed and characterized. Further, non-targeting control or EHD1-KD TC71 cells engineered with RFP-luciferase reporter were implanted in the tibia of nude mice in an orthotopic xenograft model and tumor growth was monitored by IVIS imaging. Results: EHD1-KD led to a significant impairment of EWS cell proliferation, migration, invasion, softagar colony formation, and tumor-sphere formation in vitro and reduced tumor growth in nude mice. Using a phospho-RTK profiling antibody array, we found reduced phospho-IGF1R levels upon EHD1-KD, identifying IGF1R as a potential target of regulation by EHD1. Western blotting showed a reduction in total IGF1R levels, and flow cytometric and immunofluorescence analyses revealed a pronounced decrease in the cell surface IGF1R levels upon EHD1 KD/KO in EWS cell lines. EHD1- KO EWS cell lines also exhibited a defect in IGF1-dependent migration and proliferation, and the phenotypes were restored by mouse EHD1 rescue. IGF1R and EHD1 were found to colocalize intracellularly and to co-immunoprecipitate after IGF1 stimulation. Finally, EHD1 depletion was found to impair the IGF-1R-mediated activation of downstream AKT and MAPK pathways. Conclusion: Our studies indicate a novel requirement of the intracellular traffic regulator EHD1 in sustaining IGF1R mediated oncogenesis in EWS. Future studies will aim to evaluate dual targeting of EHD1 and IGF1R in EWS.</td>

      <td>STAT3-driven MAPK activation represents a therapeutic vulnerability in ASCL1 high SCLC</td>
      <td>Background Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive high grade neuroendocrine tumor (Hann et al. 2019; Bernhardt et al. 2016). Whilst MAPK mutations can be found in roughly 30% of human cancers (Schubbert et al. 2007) including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), genomic and proteomic analyses have indicated suppression of MAPK pathway activity in SCLC (Cerami et al. 2012; Gao et al. 2013). Previous attempts to determine whether this might be therapeutically important (Ravi et al, 1998; Cristea et al. 2016/2020) have had conflicting conclusions. SCLC has recently been defined by the relative expression of four major transcriptional regulators (ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, YAP1) (Rudin et al., 2019). In this study we aimed to elucidate the effect of MAPK activation in these different SCLC subtypes and explore its therapeutic vulnerability. Results ASCL1-, NEUROD1- and POU2F3- driven SCLC cell lines were transduced with a doxycycline-inducible vector for expression of MEKDD(S217D/S221D) (MEK1). Activation through MEK1 in ASCL1-driven SCLC cell lines resulted in a significant decrease in cell growth over 9 days. This was associated with G2 cell-cycle arrest and senescence. Expression of MEK1 in the cells of other SCLC subtypes and NSCLC failed to show any appreciable changes in cell growth. Remarkably, athymic mice injected with a MEK1 expressing ASCL1-driven cell line showed significantly slower tumor formation and longer survival than when MEK1 was not expressed. Notably, we observed the opposite when MEK1 expressing NEUROD1-driven cells were injected into athymic mice. We observed strong upregulation of negative feedback regulators DUSP6 and SPRY2 upon MAPK activation which has previously been described in solid tumors and pre-B ALL (Courtois-Cox et al 2006; Shojaee et al. 2015). Interestingly, phosphokinase array demonstrated that, almost exclusively, STAT3 through phosphorylation at S727 was strongly upregulated in the ASCL1-driven subtype after MEK1 expression. This prompted us to look at other regulators of the JAK-STAT pathway and found an increase in phosphorylation of the inhibitory phosphatase PTPN6 (SHP1) in the ASCL1-driven subtype and no STAT5 phosphorylation in any of the subtypes. We next examined whether these cells were sensitive to STAT3 inhibition. Upon treatment with a STAT3 inhibitor, stattic, ASCL1-driven SCLC cells reached their IC(50) after 3-5 days in comparison to 9 days for other SCLC subtypes. MEK inhibition through PD0325901 rescued growth inhibition upon MAPK activation and was further associated with a decrease in DUSP6, SPRY2 and pS727 STAT3. JAK1/2 inhibition through ruxolitinib had no effect on cell viability. Summary These findings suggest that ASCL1-driven SCLC in vitro and in vivo is sensitive to activation of MAPK signaling. Our data provides additional understanding of SCLC biology and its complex signaling networks and potential subtype-specific drug susceptibilities.</td>

We hypothesized combined Vitamin D3 (Paricalcitol; Par) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impacts stroma, anti-tumor immunity, and autophagy, thereby sensitizing PDAC to gemcitabine (Gem). Methods For subcutaneous efficacy, 5-6-week-old female nude mice (n=5/group) were injected with KPC-Luc cells and randomized to: 1) vehicle (PBS), 2) Gem plus HCQ, 3) Gem plus Par, and 4) Gem, HCQ, and Par once tumors were palpable. Gem and Par (twice weekly) were administered via intraperitoneal injection. HCQ was given orally (daily). For orthotropic efficacy and single cell analysis, female C57BL/6J mice (n=6/group) were injected with 2×105 KPC-Luc cells into the pancreas tail. On day 5, animals were randomized to 1) PBS and 2) combined Gem/HCQ/Par as above. Tumors were analyzed via bioluminescent imaging. After 15 days, animals were euthanized, tumors were weighed and dissociated into single cells. High viability samples were used to generate scRNA-Seq libraries using 10X genomics droplet approach. Results Gem, HCQ, and Par significantly (p&lt;0.001) reduced tumor growth/weight versus controls in both models. Single cell transcriptome profiles of 11,188 cells (controls) and 7,624 cells (Gem/HCQ/Par) were obtained. Split UMAP plots of samples were generated with cell clusters annotated from established gene markers. Eight clusters expressing PDAC-associated genes were designated as PDAC cells. The tumor microenvironment (TME) showed dramatic post-treatment changes with significant decreases in PDAC cells (p=0.007) and increases in B cells, monocytes/macrophages (p=0.0006, 0.03 respectively), and increased T/NK cells in treated versus control mice. Supervised analysis among T cells showed more activation (Cd44, Tnfrsf4/9) and exhaustion (Ctla4, Lag3, Pdcd1) associated gene expression post-treatment, indicating robust T cell response. ssGSEA analysis showed significant (p&lt;.001) activation of Th1/Th2/Th17 pathways. Monocyte/macrophages clusters analysis revealed greater expression of M1 genes and M2 genes in treated and control samples, respectively. Modified EMT was observed in stromal cells with enhanced MHC1 expression. Conclusion HCQ and Par enhance the efficacy of Gem in two mice PDAC models. Single cell transcriptome analyses revealed the combination treatment promoted immune shifts in the PDAC TME. Effects of Par and HCQ and standard chemotherapy drugs, Gem and nab-paclitaxel are being studied in an ongoing clinical trial (NCT04524702).</td>

      <td>Targeting protein secretion as a novel therapeutic strategy in AL amyloidosis</td>
      <td>AL amyloidosis (AL) is an incurable plasma cell disorder. The solely pathogenic mechanism in AL is deposition of immunoglobulin free light chains (FLC) organized in fibrils in target organs. Surprisingly, therapeutic strategies directly targeting FLC secretion are not available. SNARE proteins, which are the specific target of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), are involved in the docking and fusion of secretory vesicles. We hypothesized that certain BoNT serotypes may block FLC secretion and trigger cytotoxicity triggering a terminal UPR. Gene expression profiling in a cohort of 170 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients (IFM170) was used to interrogate SNAREs expression in malignant plasma cells. We developed tetracycline inducible, bicistronic vectors expressing distinct BoNT serotypes (BoNT/A-F), T2A and GFP. Lentivirally transduced cells would express BoNT in a 1:1 stochiometric ratio with GFP, upon doxycycline (dox) administration. We transduced AL cell lines stably expressing rRTA with Tet-On lentivirus expressing 7 distinct BoNTs and performed two sets of experiments. First, we performed time-course viability assays on polyclonally transduced cells and compared relative proportion of GFP+ cells over time. Then, we single-cell sorted transduced cells, triggered BoNT expression and assessed GFP kinetic and apoptosis at 24, 48 and 72 hours post dox. SNAREs cleavage following induction of BoNT expression was evaluated via WB in GFP+ clones. To assess if BoNT cytotoxicity correlated with cessation of FLC secretion, we performed a secretion assay in monoclones expressing distinct BoNTs. IFM170 GEP and AL/MM cell lines analysis showed VAMP2, VAMP3 and SNAP23 as the top expressed SNAREs. By using polyclonally transduced cells, we show that GFP+ (transduced) cells are rapidly depleted over time after dox, across all serotypes, except BoNT/B, consistent with cytotoxic effect. We noted an association between SNAP23 and VAMP3 cleavage and BoNT toxicity, suggesting that dual targeting of SNAP23/VAMP3 may be necessary to mediate BoNT cytotoxicity. We next show that only BoNTs causing early cytotoxicity (A, D, E and F) significantly inhibited FLC secretion and induced UPR activation, presumably through FLC retention. Indeed, cytotoxic BoNTs, activated PERK pathway with eIF2a phosphorylation (p-eIF2a); ATF4, CHOP and GADD34 upregulation. Importantly preliminary data in CHOP KO AL cells show rescue of BoNT-induced death, confirming that a terminal UPR is the mechanism of cytotoxicity of BoNT in AL. We show that in all seven BoNT serotypes examined, except for BoNT/B, simultaneous cleavage of SNAP23 and VAMP3 predicts BoNT cytotoxicity and correlates with cessation of FLC secretion and terminal UPR. Overall, our preliminary data provide proof of concept that targeting FLC secretion is feasible and of therapeutic efficacy in preclinical AL models, suggesting potential clinical translatability of this innovative approach.</td>

      <td>Efficacy of triple combination treatment with trametinib, mebendazole and CD133 RNA aptamer in recalcitrant NRAS-mutant melanoma cells</td>
      <td>Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Although kinase inhibitors have proven to be efficient with promising clinical results, the development of drug resistance is one of the major issues in targeted therapy. CD133, also known asProminin-1, is a membrane glycoprotein studied extensively as a cell surface marker for cancer stem cells. In our previous studies, mebendazole, a repurposed broad spectrum anti-helminthic agent, inhibited the growth of NRAS mutant melanoma cells in combination with trametinib, a MEK inhibitor. However, a CD133-positive cancer stem cell population remain resistant to this targeted therapy. Use of RNA aptamers in diagnostic as well as therapeutics has been studied recently in different types of cancer cells. Drug delivery of aCD133 aptamer coupled with doxorubicin has been found to inhibit the growth of liver cancer cells. In this study, we targeted the cancer stem cells expressing CD133 with RNA aptamers, in combination with trametinib and mebendazole to sensitize the cells to the combination treatment. Patient derived melanoma cell lines, BAKP and POT, harboring BRAFWT/NRASQ61K and BRAFWT/NRASQ61R driver mutations, were co-transduced with aTet-on vector expressing CD133 and a Tet activator. The doxycycline-induced and uninduced cells were subjected to single agent treatment with 100 nM trametinib, 100 nM mebendazole or 100 nM CD133 RNA aptamer, as well as dual and triple agent combinations for 24 or 48 hours. XTT cell viability and apoptotic assays such as AnnexinV-PI flow cytometry analysis revealed that the triple combination with trametinib, mebendazole and the CD133 aptamer was the most effective in inducing apoptotic cell death, even in the doxycycline-induced CD133-overexpressing melanoma cells. Further studies will use preclinical in vivo mouse xenograft models to investigate the effects on tumor growth of CD133 RNA aptamers in combination treatments, potentially making it available for clinical trials aiming to improve patient response to therapeutics against drug-resistant melanoma cells.</td>

      <td>Single-cell CRISPR screen of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST)</td>
      <td>Background: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are aggressive sarcomas of the peripheral nervous system. Loss of function of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) have been identified in up to 80% of MPNST cases, via recurrent genetic mutations in the core components, EED and/or SUZ12. However, the transcriptional mis-regulation incurred by the loss of transcriptional repression in MPNST, through loss of H3K27me3, has yet to be fully deciphered. We hypothesize that PRC2 loss leads to transcriptional regulatory imbalance between key epigenetic regulating complexes in this malignancy, which may contribute to the oncogenesis of this disease. Therefore, this project aims to elucidate the role of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes in MPNST, epigenetic regulators known to act antagonistically to PRC2. Method: This project uses a CRISPR knock out screen combined with a single cell RNA sequencing readout to target 44 known components of the SWI/SNF complexes. This technology enables large scale phenotypic assays, which we leverage to decipher the complicated epigenetic regulatory network within these lesions. Resulting genes of interest were further studied via loss-of-function assays coupled with colony formation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments. Results: This CRISPR screen highlighted core SWI/SNF components, SMARCA4 and SMARCE1, as genes of interest in MPNST. Knockdown of these genes in MPNST cell lines reduced proliferation, indicating a role for these genes in MPNST growth and viability. Further, investigations via soft agar assay found both SMARCA4 and SMARCE1 knock out to decrease the tumorigenic potential of MPNST cells. The potential dependency of SMARCA4 function in MPNST cells on PRC2 mutation was investigated using a doxycycline-inducible PRC2-restoration MPNST cell line model. ChIP-seq results suggest that loss of PRC2 does not substantially affect the binding of SMARCA4-containing SWI/SNF complexes across the genome. DPF1, a member of the neuronal-specific SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, was further highlighted as a unique regulator of MPNST transcription via the CRISPR single-cell screen. CRISPR knockdown of this gene in MPNST cell lines has been found to decrease proliferation, while soft agar assay experiments highlighted that DPF1 loss reduces cell tumorigenicity. The unique dependency of this gene observed in MPNST but not in any other cancer subtypes highlights the potential of DPF1 to be a novel and unique therapeutic target in MPNST. Conclusion: Thus far, our studies have shown that members of the SWI/SNF complex play key roles in the MPNST cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. The function of these complexes in MPNST, however, may be independent of the transcriptional imbalance caused by PRC2 mutation.</td>

      <td>An antifungal, Itraconazole, induces cell death by targeting HER2 signaling and stem-like properties in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer</td>
      <td>Trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer leads to a poorer prognosis and shorter overall survival. Identifying existing drugs for another purpose of use may be considered as a part of new approaches to overcome resistance in cancer biology. Itraconazole is a FDA-approved drug, which is one of anti-fungal drugs. This drug has been reported to exploit as a cancer therapeutic agent in several cancer types. We sought to investigate the anti-cancer effects of itraconazole on cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy and breast cancer stem cell-like properties in terms of challenging trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer. The effect of itraconazole on trastuzumab-resistant cell line, JIMT-1, in vitro was examined in aspects of cell viability, apoptosis, autophagy, and impact on cancer stem cells. As in vivo experimental model, trastuzumab-resistant JIMT-1 cells were implanted to generate xenografts to study anti-tumor efficacy of itraconazole. Treatment of itraconazole significantly suppressed the growth of JIMT-1 cells with marked induction of apoptosis. Itraconazole downregulated p185HER2 and truncated-p95HER2, and their phosphorylation levels in JIMT-1 cells. In addition, the outcome of the decrease in the levels of Beclin-1 and p62 and the increase of LC3 I/II after the exposure to itraconazole supported that itraconazole induced autophagy as well. Importantly, itraconazole not only killed proliferating tumor cells but also effectively eradicated cancer stem-like populations. To elucidate eradication of cancer stem-like population by itraconazole, ALDH1 activity assay and FACS analysis of CD44+/CD24- stem-like phenotype in JIMT-1 cells were carried out. As a result, stem-cell like populations were impaired as evidenced by a significant decrease in ALDH1 activity and CD44+/CD24- stem-like populations. Through in vivo mouse model, the physiological relevance of in vitro observations was confirmed. Evident inhibition of tumor burden and growth in trastuzumab-resistant xenografts was shown in consequence of itraconazole administration, accompanying by substantial downregulation of HER2, ALDH1 and microvessel density as well as dramatic decrease of p62 in vivo. No injury to liver or kidneys by itraconazol was found based on no statistically significant difference in serum levels of ALT, AST and BUN between vehicle- and itraconazole-administrated groups. We have demonstrated that itraconazole, which is FDA-approved drug as an anti-fungal drug, exerts antitumor activity in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer by targeting cancer stem-like properties, suppression of the HER2 signaling as well as induction of autophagy. These findings support the notion that itraconazole might be a new strategic approach as a treatment for trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancers.</td>

      <td>CD133 stimulates cell proliferationviaupregulation of amphiregulin in melanoma</td>
      <td>Melanoma, a malignant transformation of melanocytes, accounts for 90% of skin cancer deaths due to its ability to efficiently metastasize to other organs. CD133, also known as Prominin1, is a pentaspan glycosylated transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in cancer stem cells from various tumors, including melanoma, and has been associated with tumor recurrence, chemoresistance, and metastasis. To characterize and target CD133-positive cancer stem cells, patient-derived melanoma cell lines BAKP and POT, harboring BRAFWT/NRASQ61K and BRAFWT/NRASQ61R driver mutations, respectively, were co-transduced with a Tet activator (rtTA3) and a Tet-on vector expressing CD133 (TRE3G-CD133) to produce stable doxycycline (Dox)- inducible cell lines. These cell lines were exposed to Dox (1μg/mL) to induce CD133 expression for 24 h; mRNA was extracted and subjected to RNA-seq analysis, followed by bioinformatic analyses, which revealed genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated by Dox-induced CD133 expression. Among the most significantly altered genes was amphiregulin (AREG), which increased 7-fold with Dox induction. These results were validated in both BAKP and POT cell lines by qPCR and immunoblot analysis. AREG binds EGFR and activates RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, leading to cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Consistently, cell cycle and cell growth analyses revealed that Dox-induced CD133 expression increases the percent of cells in S-phase of the cell cycle, leading to increased cell growth in BAKP cells. The role of CD133 in cell proliferation via AREG upregulation was further studied with immunofluorescent and flow cytometry analysis of proliferation markers PCNA, Ki67, as well as BrdU incorporation into newly synthesized DNA in Dox-induced BAKP cells, with or without siRNA knockdown of AREG. AREG may play an integral role in melanoma progression due to its vital function in cell proliferation, serving as an attractive target for novel therapeutics in melanoma and cancers exhibiting overexpression of both CD133 and AREG. Further studies using specific AREG inhibitors or RNAi knockdown in melanoma cell lines is currently ongoing, and can further elucidate molecular mechanisms highlighting the role(s) of CD133 and AREG in melanoma cancer stem cells.</td>

      <td>Identification of lymphocyte activation gene 3 binding peptides using phage displayed peptide libraries for cancer immunotherapy</td>
      <td>Treatment with immune checkpoint blockades against cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein-4, programmed cell death-1, and programmed death-ligand 1 is currently giving improved results to many cancer patients. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint blockades are still largely unsatisfied with the benefits of these drugs. One of the reasons is that cancer cells also use other immune checkpoints such as lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains, and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3. LAG-3 negatively regulates activated T cells. In this study, we screened phage displayed-peptide libraries for peptides that selectively bind to LAG-3. After five rounds of screening, we selected a candidate peptide and named it LAG3Pep. LAG3Pep preferentially bound to human LAG-3-transfected HEK 293T cells over mock-transfected cells and phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin/chloroquine-stimulated Jurkat T cells over unstimulated cells. LAG3Pep also bound to splenocytes isolated from tumor-bearing mice, suggesting the reactivity across human and mouse LAG-3. Pull-down of Jurkat T cell lysates using biotin-labeled LAG3Pep yielded a protein band of LAG-3. A competition by the pre-treatment of Jurkat T cells with a LAG-3-blocking antibody inhibited the cell binding of LAG3Pep. In addition, LAG3Pep inhibited the binding of LAG-3 protein to THP-1 cells expressing HLA-DR, a well-known LAG-3 ligand. Moreover, LAG3Pep recovered IL2 production by stimulated Jurkat T cells, which were suppressed by fibrinogen-like protein 1, another ligand of LAG-3, in the culture medium of HepG2 tumor cells. These results show that LAG3Pep selectively binds to LAG-3 and has a potential as a LAG-3 blocker for cancer immunotherapy.</td>

      <td>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by limited therapeutic options and an extremely high mortality-to-incidence ratio. Chemotherapy remains the primary treatment for metastatic disease and results in only modest improvements in median overall survival, typically with significant toxicity. We previously reported a novel treatment approach with the combination of the imipridone ONC212 and the MEK inhibitor trametinib. This combination demonstrated synergy in multiple KRAS-mutated and KRAS wild-type pancreatic cancer cell lines (BxPC3, PANC1, HPAF-II, AsPC-1). Using Western Blot, we assessed markers of autophagy, including Beclin-1 and LC3B, as well as key second messenger pathway activation/suppression with p-AKT/AKT and p-ERK/ERK. The mechanism of this synergy appears to be heterogeneous, working through autophagy inhibition, MAPK/PI3K pathway perturbation, activation of the integrated stress response and increased cell surface expression of death receptor 5. Further investigation has revealed that ONC212 also appears to synergize with various autophagy inhibitors including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. We hypothesized that combining trametinib and ONC212 may also induce cell death in-part through immune cell-mediated mechanisms. To explore this, we performed immune cell co-culture experiments using HPAF-II PDAC cells and natural killer (NK-92) cells at a 1:1 effector-to-target cell ratio with or without ONC212, trametinib, or the combination of the two at different concentrations. We assessed the levels of NK cell mediated-tumor cell death 4, 8, and 24- hours after simultaneous treatment and initiation of co-culture using fluorescent microscopy. Compared to trametinib, ONC212 only treated co-culture showed greater NK cell-mediated tumor cell death. At 24-hours, we also observed an increase in NK cell-mediated killing of PDAC cells with dual treatment as compared to single agent alone or vehicle controls. Importantly, this combination did not appear to have any effect on NK or tumor cell viability. Thus, this combination may represent a potential therapeutic modality for PDAC and may hold promise if combined with immunotherapy. Further in vitro experiments will be conducted to evaluate the effect of ONC212, trametinib, and other autophagy inhibitors on the PDAC tumor microenvironment using a T cell co-culture system. Similarly, in vivo murine studies will also be performed to assess the translational potential of this combination.</td>

      <td>Pharmacologic ascorbate opens a therapeutic window for ATM inhibition and radiotherapy in colorectal cancer</td>
      <td>Purpose/Objective(s): The ATM protein is key to DNA double strand break (DSB) repair and ATM inhibitors are potent radiosensitizers. Clinical translation of these agents in combination with radiotherapy (RT) has been limited due to concerns for increased normal tissue toxicity. Pharmacologic Ascorbate (P-AscH-) radiosensitizes cancer cells via generation of a H(2)O(2) flux while acting as a radioprotector in normal tissue via free radicle scavenging. We hypothesized that P-AscH- could open a therapeutic window for the combination of RT and ATM inhibition in colorectal cancer (CRC). Materials/Methods: Multiple human and murine CRC cell lines were used in vitro. Clonogenic survival was assessed after combinations of RT +/- P-AscH and DNA Repair Inhibitors (DRIs). Catalase expression was induced using HCT116 cells expressing a doxycycline-inducible catalase transgene. DSBs were quantified using neutral comet assays. Cell cycle distribution were assessed using flow cytometry. ATM localization/activation were assessed using IF. Normal tissue toxicity in vivo was assessed using IHC following whole-abdominal RT. Survival and tumor growth delay was assessed following 5Gyx3 +/- drug treatment to unilateral flank tumors in syngeneic/xenograft models. Results: DRIs were potent radiosensitizers in most CRC cell lines and the addition of P-AscHfurther reduced clonogenic survival. In contrast, P-AscH- did not radiosensitize HUVEC or FHs-74int normal cell lines. P-AscH- significantly increased the number of DSBs in tumors after RT in vitro. PAscH- simultaneously decreased nuclear localization and activation of pATM after RT and perturbed G2+M phase progression. In vivo, the addition of P-AscH- to RT + KU60019 significantly increased survival delayed tumor growth in syngeneic/xenograft models while ameliorating increased normal bowel toxicity as measured by jejunal crypt density, acute weight loss, rectal injury, and markers of oxidative stress following whole-abdominal RT. The effects of P-AscH were reversed by inducing the overexpression of catalase. Conclusion: P-AscH- improves both aspects of the therapeutic window of RT+ATM inhibition in CRC by simultaneously enhancing tumor efficacy while decreasing RT-mediated bowel toxicity. The effects of P-AscH- on clonogenic survival, initial and persistent DSBs, G2+M phase perturbations, ATM activation/localization, and in vivo survival and tumor growth delay were dependent on H202 flux. Normal tissue protection appears to be related to decreased oxidative stress.</td>

      <td>Cell migration is regulated by multiple molecular pathways to change the morphology from epithelial to mesenchymal type and is important in cancer metastasis. In has been demonstrated epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is related to E-cadherin expression level. The loss of E-cadherin expression results in tumor proliferation and metastasis. Recently, studies have been demonstrated the collective cancer cell migration which expresses high E-cadherin is a powerful mechanism of metastasis. Therefore, the role of E-cadherin in cancer metastasis is still not clear. Clathrinmediated endocytosis (CME) was shown to regulate E-cadherin turnover on the membrane and the function of lysosome is also associated with cell vesicle trafficking, however, the role of lysosome in collective cell migration is not known. This study is investigating the role of lysosome in regulating E-cadherin dynamics through vesicle trafficking in collective colon cell migration. In the experiment, we used colon cancer cells with epithelial morphology and observed the relation of E-cadherin with endocytic protein clathrin, Rab5 and the recycling protein Rab11 in collective migrated cells. In the result, inhibition of lysosome activity by chloroquine treatment has great suppression effect on anchorage independent cell growth and inhibited collective cell migration. We observed that nocodazole treatment inhibited clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which caused E-cadherin to accumulate on the cell membrane. Western blot and confocal microscopy demonstrated chloroquine treatment induced Rab11 expression and accumulated in the cytosol which affected Ecadherin turnover. Our results demonstrated inhibits lysosome activity can suppress colon cancer cell growth and collective migration through lysosome mediated E-cadherin translocation. Chloroquine may be the potential treatment for colon cancer therapy.</td>

      <td>Minocycline-based metronomic therapy as a novel approach to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and reduce tumor burden in mouse models of colorectal cancer</td>
      <td>Despite the availability of numerous new therapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors, patients with colon cancer are faced with limited treatment options. We recently demonstrated that low metronomic dose of PARP inhibitor synergizes with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, in part, by modulating the suppressive function of MDSCs via a reduction in Arg1 and iNOS but independently of DNA damage and STING (PMC7839867). The non-antibiotic properties of minocycline (Mc) include its ability to moderately inhibit PARP. We took advantage of Mc as a weak PARP inhibitor to explore its potential on tumorigenesis and immune suppression in colon cancer models. In this study, we show that Mc significantly reduced Arg1 and iNOS in bone marrow (BM)-derived MDSCs both at the mRNA and protein levels. Paradoxically, such strong effect did not culminate in a substantial modulation of MDSCs suppressive function as assessed by co-cultured anti-CD3/CD28- stimulated CFSE-labeled T cells proliferation. However and similarly to PARP inhibitors, Mc increased PD-L1 expression in several cell types. We thus speculated that the antibiotic might enhance anti-cancer immunotherapy and explored such potential in a MC-38 and CT-26 cell-based mouse models of colon cancer representing the MSI and MSS traits of the disease. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with low metronomic doses of Mc (0.5 or 5mkg) promoted a substantial reduction in tumor size in the MC-38 cell-based model (MSI) without an apparent superiority of any of the two doses. Surprisingly, neither dose of Mc exerted appreciable effects on tumor size in the CT-26 cell-based model (MSS). The anti-tumor effect of Mc in the MSI model was associated with a significant reduction in intratumoral monocytic-MDSC population. While MDSCs harvested from tumors of control mice re-infiltrated ex vivo generated MC-38 cell-based organoids, MDSCs harvested from tumors of Mc-treated mice failed to re-infiltrate the organoids. This suggests that Mc may interfere with MDSCs intratumorally infiltration. The Mc concentrations used in this study exerted little to no effect on bacterial growth suggesting that the observed effects were independent of the antibiotic properties of the drug. Unlike the effects observed in vitro, Mc treatment reduced intratumoral PD-L1 while increasing IFNγ. The discrepancy may be associated with intratumoral stress condition as assessed by Chop protein levels and reproduced in vitro by serum starvation. Although the metronomic Mc dose and anti-PD1 administration caused a significant reduction in tumor size individually, the combination therapy promoted a 66.7% curing of the tumors. Our results propose repurposing Mc at metronomic doses as a new approach to enhance efficacy of immunotherapy for patients with MSI colon cancer.</td>

      <td>Prevention of non-small cell lung cancer with kras mutation using a novel peptide vaccine</td>
      <td>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a significant health issue associated with morbidity and mortality. One of the important findings to emerge in NSCLC is that specific genetic mutations that lead to cancer development occur early in the disease process. Unfortunately, identifying NSCLC at its earliest stages when it is curable has been a challenge even in high risk individuals. These gene mutations, especially those involving the Kras protein, can “drive” the development of NSCLC cancer as they alter the regulation of cell growth or block programmed cell death. Mutations in Kras have been reported in 30% of lung cancer cases and are associated with worse outcomes. This neo-antigen cannot generate effective anti-tumor immunity, suggesting lack of a cellular, cytotoxic immune response to cancer cells on mucosal/epithelial surfaces. No effective therapies specifically targeting mutant Kras have been developed. To overcome poor immunogenicity of neo-antigen, newer adjuvants (NA), biocompatible nanoparticles, were used to enhance immune response. It has been reported NA can produce cytotoxic and mucosal immunity safely in humans. Producing this type of immune response to mutated Kras through immunization could produce a significant anti-tumor effect. In the current study, we first tested NA combined with mutated and wild type (MHC II) Kras peptides vaccine for immunogenicity on the same genetic background as the animals in the inducible tumor model. Our data have demonstrated that NA in combination with multiple Kras peptides can increase CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers in the draining lymph node cells and enhance antigen specific TH1 and TH17 responses by luminex and ELISpot to increase the ability of the vaccine to kill tumor cells and elicit long-lasting immune memory. Furthermore, we evaluated anti-tumor efficacy of this vaccine in tetracycline-inducible mouse model with Kras mutation. In this challenge model, vaccinated mice showed higher IFNγ and IL-17 levels and decreased the tumor incidence significantly compared to PBS or peptides alone group. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the antigen-specific cellular immune responses and mononuclear cell infiltrates correlate with tumor prevention. Our data suggest that this novel vaccine could prevent the development of NSCLC after validation in an appropriate animal model.</td>

      <td>HER2+ is a breast cancer (BC) subtype characterized by the overexpression/amplification of HER2. Patients receive trastuzumab (Tz) but many (27-42%) do not achieve an objective response. We demonstrated that the overexpression of TNF? induces Tz resistance in tumors by upregulating the membrane glycoprotein MUC4, which masks Tz epitope on HER2, impairing its binding and reducing its therapeutic effects. We have also proved that blocking the soluble TNF? isoform with INB03 (DN) reduces MUC4 expression, overcomes Tz resistance and unleashes an antitumor innate immune response characterized by an increase in NK cell-activation and degranulation and a macrophage (M?) polarization to the M1 subtype. This study aims to determine the impact of MUC4 expression on M? and NK cells antitumor activity in the presence of Tz or Tz+DN, and on human T-lymphocyte recruitment and differentiation. Tzresistant HER2+ BC human cell lines, JIMT-1 and KPL-4, were genetically modified to stably express a doxycycline-inducible (Dox) MUC4 shRNA (shMUC4) or a scramble one (shControl), and injected s.c. into female nude mice. After tumor establishment, the animals were randomly divided into a control group (-Dox) or an induced group (+Dox), and treated twice a week i.p. with IgG (5 mg/kg) or Tz+DN (5 and 10 mg/kg each, respectively) (-Dox) and with IgG or Tz (+Dox). Chlodronate or anti-asialo GM1 was used to deplete M? or NK cells, respectively. Tumor volume was measured routinely and, at the end point, tumors were processed and infiltrating immune cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. In -Dox tumors, both M? and NK cells are needed to achieve Tz+DN antitumor effect (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05, respectively). However, upon MUC4 silencing, only M? are required to mediate Tz antitumor effect (p&lt;0.01). To address MUC4 role on T-lymphocyte differentiation, we isolated human T-cells from peripheral blood, activated them with CD3/CD28 beads and exposed them to conditioned mediums obtained from JIMT-1 and KPL-4 cells with or without MUC4 expression. The absence of MUC4 generated a secretome that promoted the differentiation of naïve T-cells to an effector subtype. Finally, we studied the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in a cohort of 90 patients with HER2+ BC and found a negative correlation between the presence of TILs and MUC4 expression (p=0.01). We conclude that M? are key players in the Tz-mediated antitumor innate immune response. Moreover, MUC4 expression impairs T-cell effector function and promotes immunologically cold HER2+ tumors, an additional resistance mechanism of this glycoprotein. We propose that women with HER2+MUC4+ BC could benefit from the combined treatment of Tz+DN to enhance innate and adaptive antitumor immune responses and prevent or overcome Tz resistance. Because MUC4 expression can be easily determined from biopsy tissue, early determination of MUC4 status in HER2+ BC could guide therapeutic choices to improve treatment outcomes.</td>

      <td>Antigen-mediated antibody internalization is an important factor influencing kinetics and efficacy of antibody-based therapeutics. Antibodies directed against HER2, CD20, FLT3, EGFR, CD10 and CD22 have been shown to undergo internalization upon binding to their target antigens. Although antibody-induced internalization may be desirable under some circumstances, for example in case of antibody-drug conjugates, it can subvert the therapeutic efficacy of ADCC-inducing antibodies and bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) aiming to mobilize T cells against cancer. Here we examined the turnover of PSMA, a target antigen widely used for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in prostate cancer. As a model system, we used prostate cancer cell lines expressing varying levels of PSMA in functional analyses with our PSMAxCD3 bsAb CC-1 which is currently being evaluated in two clinical trials (NCT04104607 and NCT04496674). Antigen internalization kinetics was analyzed by flow cytometric-internalization assays and live-cell imaging of antibody internalization. These analyses revealed that surface PSMA expression is rapidly downregulated after binding of PSMAxCD3 bsAb. Internalization occured in a dose-dependent manner, with complete negativity observed at concentrations ≥0.1 μg/ml. After withdrawal of the bsAb, antigen surface levels were fully restored within 24 hours. PSMA internalization was found to be partially prevented by inhibiting clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Currently, we are screening various clinically approved clathrin-dependent endocytosis inhibitors (e.g. statins and chloroquine) to identify compounds for combinatorial approaches to prevent undesired PSMA internalization in patients receiving PSMAxCD3 bsAbs. Altogether, our results document the involvement of clathrin-dependent endocytosis in bsAbs-driven PSMA internalization and provide a basis for combinatorial approaches to increase the efficacy of PSMA-directed therapeutics.</td>

      <td>Aurora kinase is an actionable target in low molecular weight cyclin E induced mammary tumors</td>
      <td>Background: Cyclin E, a key mediator for G1 to S transition, has unique tumor-specific deregulation in multiple malignancies including breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. Our group previously reported that the oncogenic roles of cyclin E are primarily a consequence of the accumulation of several truncated forms, collectively termed low-molecular-weight cyclin E (LMW-E). LMW-E isoforms provide a growth advantage by inducing early G1 to S phase transition, genomic instability, increased cell proliferation and metastasis, as shown in breast cancer cell lines and transgenic mouse models. Clinically, assessment of 2,500 breast cancer patients has revealed that LMW-E expression in tumors is associated with a high risk of recurrence across all subtypes. Further, LMWE expression is an independent predictor of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Current gaps in knowledge in the field that remain pertain to (i) if LMW-E is an early or late event in oncogenesis (ii) if it is required for both the initiation and maintenance of mammary tumors, (iii) the secondary oncogenic events induced by LMW-E and if these events can be targeted therapeutically. Methods: To address the above questions, we generated three tetracycline-inducible LMW-E (TLMW-E) transgenic model systems with expression of mammary specific human LMW-E in different genetic backgrounds: These include a bi-transgenic model (MMTV-rtTA and Tet-O-LMWE), a tri-transgenic (bi-transgenic in a p53+/- background) and quad-transgenic (tri-transgenic in a cyclin E knockout background). For each model, TLMW-E mediated tumor initiation, progression and metastasis, is reported as a function of time. Molecular analysis of the mammary gland and tumors are performed to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities of LMW-E expressing tumors. Results: TLMW-E dependent alterations in cell cycle are early and irreversible events, leading to increased proliferation starting from the hyperplastic stages of tumor development. Transcriptomic analysis of TLMW-E derived mammary tumors revealed significant alterations in the G2/M transition and E2F signaling. We also interrogated the role of G2/M regulator, Aurora Kinase A (AURKA), that was altered in a TLMW-E dependent fashion. Correlative analysis using publicly available datasets confirmed the linked co-overexpression of AURKA and cyclin E in basal breast cancer as compared to normal breast tissue. In vivo studies using the AURKA inhibitor, alisertib, showed that mammary tumors were sensitive to AURKA inhibition as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy, as a function of LMW-E expression. Conclusion: Collectively, our data suggest that the induced expression of LMW-E is tumorigenic, independent of p53 or endogenous cyclin E status and responsive to treatment with an AURKA inhibitor.</td>

      <td>The GPCR OR13A1 is essential for lymphoma cells</td>
      <td>Background. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins that mediate cellular responses to endogenous (amines, cations, lipids, peptides, glycoproteins) and exogenous (light, tastants, odorants) stimuli. Altered signaling pathways associated with GPCRs are implicated in the pathophysiology of various diseases, such as CXCR3/4/5, S1PR1/2/3, GPR34 in lymphomas. Olfactory receptors (ORs) are GPCRs, initially identified and characterized for their expression in olfactory neurons but now recognized as expressed in different tissues. OR51E1 is known as prostate specific G protein coupled receptor 2 (PSGR2) due to its expression in prostate cancer, OR2B6 and OR2W3 are expressed in breast cancer, and OR51E1 in melanoma. OR13A1 has been included in the double-hit expression signature reported in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Ennishi et al 2019). Here, we studied OR13A1 in lymphoma cell lines and clinical specimens. Methods. RNA-Seq and real-time PCR for evaluating the expression of ORs in DLBCL cell lines. Gene expression data for clinical samples obtained from public dataset phs001444.v2.p1. OR13A1 silencing performed with both siRNAs (OCI-Ly1, U2932) and doxycycline-inducible shRNAs (U2932); viability assessed after 3 days using MTT and for longer with Incucyte live imaging. Computer modelling performed based on available ligands for the murine orthologue Olfr211 and similar known GPCRs structure. Results. Only one OR per cell line was usually expressed, as reported for olfactory cells. Using RNA-Seq and real-time PCR, OR13A1 gene appeared the most abundantly expressed in lymphomas cell lines compared to others ORs. Its expression was seen in 35/47 B cell lymphoma lines, with higher expression in germinal center B cell (GCB) DLBCL than activated B cell like (ABC) DLBCL (P 0.03). A similar pattern was observed in patients: higher expression in GCB than ABC and in EZB than MCD (P &lt; 0.001). OR13A1 also appeared higher in normal GC cells than in naïve and memory B cells. Among GCB DLBCL patients, OR13A1 expression was associated with inferior outcome. Silencing of OR13A1 with siRNAs in GCB and ABC DLBCL cells caused &gt; 50% reduction in cell viability, and pERK downregulation. Viability data were confirmed using a doxycyclineinducible shRNA system and live cell imaging instrument. Natural compounds reported as ligands for the murine orthologue Olfr211 or in silico identified to bind as agonists (ex: tyramine) increased cell line growth and compounds predicted to bind as antagonists (ex: cyclohexanone) decreased the cell viability in the presence but not in the absence of the GPCR. Conclusion. OR13A1 gene appeared more abundantly expressed in lymphomas compared to others ORs, higher in GCB than ABC DLBCL and with a possible impact on clinical outcome.

      <td>Tumor treating fields suppression of ciliogenesis enhances temozolomide toxicity</td>
      <td>Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are low intensity, alternating intermediate frequency (200kHz) electrical fields that extend survival of glioblastoma patients receiving maintenance temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. How TTFields exert efficacy on cancer cells over normal cells, or interact with TMZ is unclear. Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles triggered by extracellular ligands, mechanical and electrical field stimulation, and are capable of promoting cancer growth and TMZ chemoresistance. We found in both low and high grade patient glioma cell lines that TTFields ablated cilia within 24 hours. Halting TTFields treatment led to recovered frequencies of elongated cilia. Cilia on normal primary astrocytes, neurons and multiciliated ependymal cells were less affected by TTFields. The TTFields-mediated loss of glioma cilia was partially rescued by chloroquine pretreatment, suggesting the effect is in part due to autophagy activation. We also observed death of ciliated cells during TTFields by live imaging. Notably, TMZ-induced stimulation of ciliogenesis in both adherent cells and gliomaspheres was blocked by TTFields. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of TTFields and TMZ on tumor cell recurrence correlated with the relative timing of TMZ exposure to TTFields and ARL13B positive cilia. Finally, TTFields disrupted cilia in patient tumors treated ex vivo. Our findings suggest TTFields efficacy may depend on the degree of tumor ciliogenesis and relative timing of TMZ treatment.</td>

      <td>Macrophages impair antigen specific CD8 + T cell response against HCC in NAFLD mice</td>
      <td>Background: Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a burgeoning etiology of liver cancer. Emerging data shows that NAFLD alters adaptive T cell immunity and has a profound influence on both liver cancer development and efficacy of immunotherapy. Tumor antigen-specific T cells recognize tumor and are crucial for controlling malignancy. However, their populations are often low, and detection requires special tools. This study utilized a novel mouse model of HCC to investigate how the tumor antigen-specific T cell response is affected in NAFLD. Methods: We generated a doxycycline-inducible MHC-I OVA257-264 and MHC-II OVA323-339 antigenexpressing HCC cell line which allowed us to investigate tumor antigen-specific T cell responses. The cell line was seeded orthotopically into the livers of diet-induced (methionine choline-deficient [MCD]) and genetic (Ob/Ob [Ob]) NAFLD mouse models. OVA257-264 specific CD8+ T cells were detected by flow cytometry using H-2Kb/OVA257-264 tetramer. Pharmacological depletion experiments were used to identify additional effector cells. Results: The creation of an inducible MHC-I and -II OVA antigen-expressing HCC cell line was validated in both in-vitro and in-vivo settings. Tumor expression of highly immunogenic OVA antigens caused a strong tumor suppression which was mostly mediated by CD8+ T cells in mice fed with normal diet. The inverse correlation between percentage of OVA257-264 specific CD8+ T cells with tumor size further supported their critical role in tumor control. In contrast, in NAFLD mice fed MCD diet as well as Ob/Ob mice, tumor OVA antigens induction failed to reduce liver tumor growth. The presence of OVA257-264 specific CD8+ T cells in NAFLD mice suggested that NAFLD did not inhibit the generation of tumor antigen-specific T cells. This was supported by the finding that OVA257-264 specific CD8+ T cells from NAFLD mice had similar cytotoxic potential, activation, degranulation, PD-1 expression, and effector memory phenotype compared to controls, suggesting an indirect mechanism for the impaired anti-tumor immunity. Immunoprofiling revealed a drastic increase of macrophages in tumor-bearing NAFLD livers. Depletion of macrophages with clodronate reversed the NAFLD caused resistance to tumor-antigen dependent tumor suppression. It was observed that there were minimal changes to the amount of TAS CD8+ T cells in doxycyclinetreated mice irrespective of clodronate depletion. There was, however, higher markers of activation such as CD69 and TNFα in clodronate-depleted mice compared to controls. Conclusions: NAFLD impairs antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity against liver tumor. The effect was not due to reduced generation or intrinsic functional changes of tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells but caused by accumulated macrophages in the liver environment.</td>

      <td>Functional characteristics of chemotherapyresistance in triple negative breast cancer</td>
      <td>Background: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype representing 15-20% of all breast cancers. TNBC often ends with a poor clinical outcome due to high histological grade and recurrence rates with few treatment options. Chemotherapy remains the standard of care for TNBC treatment, but unfortunately, patients frequently develop resistance, and alternative treatment strategies for chemoresistant disease remain a major unmet need. ERβ, a second form of the estrogen receptor, is known to be expressed in approximately 20-30% of TNBC, and ligand-mediated activation of ERβ elicits potent anti-cancer effects in chemosensitive TNBC. However, the utility of ERβ in the chemoresistant setting remains unclear. Materials and methods: To study the mechanistic basis of chemoresistance in TNBC cells and identify alternative treatment approaches for chemotherapy-resistant disease, doxorubicin-resistant (Doxo-R) and paclitaxel-resistant (Taxol-R) cell lines were generated using MDA-MB-231 cells. A Doxycycline (dox) inducible expression system was used to overexpress ERβ in these cells. RNA sequencing and transcription factor (TF) activation profiling was performed to glean a comprehensive mechanistic insight into mechanisms of resistance and the functions of ERβ, and the efficacy of ERβ targeted therapies, were assessed. Results: Doxo-R and Taxol-R cells exhibited a 3- and 12-fold decrease in sensitivity to their respective chemotherapeutic agents. Doxo-R cells were more sensitive to paclitaxel while Taxol-R cells exhibited no changes in sensitivity to doxorubicin. Expression of ERβ had no impact on the IC(50)s for either chemotherapy drug. Taxol-R cells exhibited a significantly increased number of cells in the S phase. Proliferation assays revealed that ERβ targeting agents, including estradiol (E2) and the ERβ-specific agonist LY500307 (LY), led to substantial inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion when ERβ was expressed. We identified a large spectrum of genes expression changes that were acquired in Doxo-R and Taxol-R cells. These changes included 91 kinases genes in Doxo-R cells and 164 in Taxol-R cells. TF activation profiling indicated that eight and four TFs were activated more than 2-fold, including NRF1, WT1, and SATB1 in both Doxo-R and Taxol-R cells. Conclusions: Doxo-R and Taxol-R TNBC cell lines were successfully established and serve as a good model for studying the mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance and screening effective agents to reverse or treat chemoresistant disease. As in the sensitive setting, ERβ targeted therapies may represent an alternative treatment for TNBC patients with chemorefractory ERβ+ disease, a possibility that is currently being explored through a phase II clinical trial (NCT03941730).</td>

      <td>BID expression levels determine cell fate upon AURKB inhibition</td>
      <td>Background: Aurora kinase B (AURKB) plays a key role in the regulation of mitosis, and AURKB inhibitors are in Phase II-III clinical trials. We reported previously that Chr22q11 amplification, leading to BID overexpression, was associated with apoptosis in upon AURKB inhibition (AURKBi) in NSCLC cell lines resistant to EGFR TKIs. However, it remains to be elucidated whether high levels of BID expression are associated with sensitivity to AURKBi beyond NSCLC and Chr22q11 amplification. Methods: A panel of 11 solid tumor cell lines were used in the study. Also included were the EGFRmut cell lines PC9 and 11-18, and 36 EGFR-TKI resistant clones derived from them. FISH and QPCR were used to determine copy number status; mRNA expression was studied by nCounter and RT-Q-PCR and protein expression by Western blotting. The effects of drugs were analyzed by MTT and flow cytometry. CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used for KO generation while ectopic expression was achieved by cloning the BID gene into a doxycycline-inducible pTRIPZ vector. Finally, in vivo experiments were performed by implanting tumor cells into athymic nude mice. Results: First, we analyzed copy numbers of BID and other 22q11 genes, together with BID expression levels, in the 49 cell lines included in the study. Then, we determined the dose-response curves of the cell lines for AZD2811, a specific AURKB inhibitor. We found that tumor cells with high BID expression levels were consistently sensitive to AURKB inhibition, independently of 22q11 amplification, while cell lines with low BID expression were uniformly resistant (r=0.91, p&lt;0.0001). Also, the growth of xenografts derived from the BID-high expressor H1819 cell line was inhibited by AZD2811. Gene silencing consistently rendered BID-high expressing cell lines fully resistant to Aurora B inhibition. Conversely, ectopic BID expression in BID-low cell lines significantly increased sensitivity to AURKB inhibitors particularly in absence of KRAS or BRAF mutations. Experiments using doxycycline gradients established that cell growth inhibition after treatment with AZD2811 was dose-dependent on the BID expression levels (R2=0.97). Western blotting experiments in parental and BID-silenced cells demonstrated that AZD2811 induced apoptosis in sensitive cells by a mechanism mediated by CASP-2 activation, leading to CASP-3 cleavage. In addition, CRISPR KO of the PIDDosome components (CASP-2, PIDD1 and CRADD) mimicked the effects of BID silencing, rendering BID-high expressing cells resistant to AURKB inhibition. Finally, a prevalence study including 118 tumor samples of different solid malignancies revealed high BID mRNA levels in 6% of cases. Conclusions: BID upregulation switches cell fate from survival to apoptosis in response to AURKB inhibition in a wide range of tumor cell lines from different origins. Our results pave the way to clinical exploration of AURKB inhibitors in BID overexpressing tumors.</td>

      <td>Comparative Analyses of Antibiotic Resistance Genes in Jejunum Microbiota of Pigs in Different Areas</td>
      <td>Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are emerging environmental contaminants that threaten human and animal health. Intestinal microbiota may be an important ARGs repository, and intensive animal farming is a likely contributor to the environmental burden of ARGs. Using metagenomic sequencing, we investigated the structure, function, and drug resistance of the jejunal microbial community in Landrace (LA, Kunming), Saba (SB, Kunming), Dahe (DH, Qujing), and Diannan small-ear piglets (DS, Xishuangbanna) from different areas in Yunnan Province, China. Remarkable differences in jejunal microbial diversity among the different pig breeds, while the microbial composition of pig breeds in close areas tends to be similar. Functional analysis showed that there were abundant metabolic pathways and carbohydrate enzymes in all samples. In total, 32,487 ARGs were detected in all samples, which showed resistance to 38 categories of drugs. The abundance of ARGs in jejunum was not significantly different between LA and SB from the same area, but significantly different between DS, DH and LA or SB from different areas. Therefore, the abundance of ARGs was little affected by pig breeds and microorganism community structure, but it was closely related to geographical location. In addition, as a probiotic, Lactobacillus amylovorus is also an important ARGs producing bacterium. Our results revealed the antibiotic exposure and intestinal microbial resistance of farms in the study areas, which could provide basic knowledge and potential strategies for rational use of antibiotics and reducing the risk of ARGs transmission in animal husbandry.</td>

      <td>Objectives: Serial kidney biopsy for repeat evaluation and monitoring of lupus nephritis (LN) in childhood-onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (cSLE) remains challenging, thus non-invasive biomarkers are needed. Here, we evaluate the performance of ten urine protein markers of diverse nature including cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in distinguishing disease activity in cSLE. Methods: Eighty-four pediatric patients meeting ≥4 ACR criteria for SLE were prospectively enrolled for urine assay of 10 protein markers normalized to urine creatinine, namely ALCAM, cystatin-C, hemopexin, KIM-1, MCP-1, NGAL, PF-4, Timp-1, TWEAK, and VCAM-1 by ELISA. Samples from active renal (LN) and active non-renal SLE patients were obtained prior to onset/escalation of immunosuppression. SLE disease activity was evaluated using SLEDAI-2000. 59 patients had clinically-active SLE (SLEDAI score ≥4 or having a flare), of whom 29 patients (34.5%) were classified as active renal, and 30 patients (35.7%) were active non-renal. Twenty-five healthy subjects were recruited as controls. Results: Urine concentrations of ALCAM, KIM-1, PF4 and VCAM-1 were significantly increased in active LN patients versus active non-renal SLE, inactive SLE and healthy controls. Five urine proteins differed significantly between 2 (hemopexin, NGAL, MCP1) or 3 (Cystatin-C, TWEAK) groups only, with the highest levels detected in active LN patients. Urine ALCAM, VCAM-1, PF4 and hemopexin correlated best with total SLEDAI as well as renal-SLEDAI scores (p &lt; 0.05). Urine ALCAM, VCAM-1 and hemopexin outperformed conventional laboratory measures (anti-dsDNA, complement C3 and C4) in identifying concurrent SLE disease activity among patients (AUCs 0.75, 0.81, 0.81 respectively), while urine ALCAM, VCAM-1 and PF4 were the best discriminators of renal disease activity in cSLE (AUCs 0.83, 0.88, 0.78 respectively), surpassing conventional biomarkers, including proteinuria. Unsupervised Bayesian network analysis based on conditional probabilities re-affirmed urine ALCAM as being most predictive of active LN in cSLE patients. Conclusion: Urinary ALCAM, PF4, and VCAM-1 are potential biomarkers for predicting kidney disease activity in cSLE and hold potential as surrogate markers of nephritis flares in these patients.</td>

      <td>Fungal Infections as an Uprising Threat to Human Health: Chemosensitization of Fungal Pathogens With AFP From Aspergillus giganteus</td>
      <td>Occurrence and intensity of systemic invasive fungal infections have significantly risen in recent decades with large amount of mortality and morbidity rates at global level. Treatment therapy lies on the current antifungal interventions and are often limited due to the emergence of resistance to antifungal agents. Chemosensitization of fungal strains to the conventional antimycotic drugs are of growing concern. Current antifungal drugs often have been reported with poor activity and side effects to the host and have a few number of targets to manifest their efficacy on the pathogens. Indiscriminately, the aforementioned issues have been easily resolved by the development of new intervention strategies. One such approach is to employ combinational therapy that has exhibited a great level of inhibitions than that of a single compound. Chemosensitization of pathogenic mycoses to commercial antifungal drugs could be drastically enhanced by co-application of chemosensitizers along with the conventional drugs. Chemosensitizers could address the resistance mechanisms evolved in the pathogenic fungi and targeting the system to make the organism susceptible to commercially and clinically proven antifungal drugs. However, this strategy has not been overreached to the greater level, but it needs much attention to fight against not only with the pathogen but combat the resistance mechanisms of pathogens to drugs. Natural compounds including plant compounds and microbial proteins act as potential chemosensitizers to break the resistance in mycoses. Aspergillus giganteus, a filamentous fungus, is known to produce a cysteine rich extracellular protein called as antifungal protein (AFP). AFP has shown enhanced efficacy against several filamentous and non-filamentous fungal pathogens. On the basis of the reported studies on its targeted potential against pathogenic mycoses, AFP would be fabricated as a good chemosensitizer to augment the fungicidal efficacy of commercial antimycotic drugs. This paper reviews on breakthrough in the discovery of antifungal drugs along with the resistance patterns of mycoses to commercial drugs followed by the current intervention strategies applied to augment the fungicidal potential of drugs.</td>

      <td>Background: Atazanavir/ritonavir is recommended as a preferred second-line antiretroviral regimen in children older than 3 months, alternatively to lopinavir/ritonavir. We performed a systematic review to assess safety and effectiveness of atazanavir use in children and adolescents. Methods: We searched observational studies and clinical trials on Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL database between 2009/01/01 and 2020/10/01; as well as grey literature. We extracted safety (adverse events, grade 3 or 4 adverse events, treatment discontinuation) and effectiveness (CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load) outcomes. We estimated weighted summary pooled incidence with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Results: Out of the 1,085 records screened, we included five studies (one comparative cohort, three single phase 2-3 trial arms, one retrospective cohort) reporting 975 children and adolescents, of whom 56% (544) received atazanavir. Three studies reported all-cause treatment discontinuation rates, yielding a pooled incidence of 19% [15–22] at 12 months. The comparative cohort compared atazanavir to darunavir, with few grade 3–4 adverse events, except transient hyperbilirubinemia, occurring in half (92/188) of the atazanavir patients. No death occurred (two studies reporting). Four studies described increased CD4 cell counts and decreased HIV viral load at 6 or 12 months. Conclusion: Few safety and effectiveness data were available for children and adolescents exposed to atazanavir. Transient grade 3–4 hyperbilirubinemia was the main adverse outcome reported. Immune and viral responses were descriptive. The use of atazanavir/ritonavir in children and adolescents needs further investigation, but remains a suitable option for a preferred second-line antiretroviral regimen.

      <td>Characteristics, phenotypes, mechanisms and management of severe asthma</td>
      <td>ABSTRACT: Severe asthma is "asthma which requires treatment with high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus a second controller (and/or systemic corticosteroids) to prevent it from becoming 'uncontrolled' or which remains 'uncontrolled' despite this therapy." The state of control was defined by symptoms, exacerbations and the degree of airflow obstruction. Therefore, for the diagnosis of severe asthma, it is important to have evidence for a diagnosis of asthma with an assessment of its severity, followed by a review of comorbidities, risk factors, triggers and an assessment of whether treatment is commensurate with severity, whether the prescribed treatments have been adhered to and whether inhaled therapy has been properly administered. Phenotyping of severe asthma has been introduced with the definition of a severe eosinophilic asthma phenotype characterized by recurrent exacerbations despite being on high dose ICS and sometimes oral corticosteroids, with a high blood eosinophil count and a raised level of nitric oxide in exhaled breath. This phenotype has been associated with a Type-2 (T2) inflammatory profile with expression of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Molecular phenotyping has also revealed non-T2 inflammatory phenotypes such as Type-1 or Type-17 driven phenotypes. Antibody treatments targeted at the T2 targets such as anti-IL5, anti-IL5Rα, and anti-IL4Rα antibodies are now available for treating severe eosinophilic asthma, in addition to anti-immunoglobulin E antibody for severe allergic asthma. No targeted treatments are currently available for non-T2 inflammatory phenotypes. Long-term azithromycin and bronchial thermoplasty may be considered. The future lies with molecular phenotyping of the airway inflammatory process to refine asthma endotypes for precision medicine.</td>

Methods: In this prospective multicenter cohort study, children with POAIs were selected from the European Union Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Diseases Study (EUCLIDS) database to analyze their demographic, clinical, and microbiological data. Results: A cohort of 380 patients with POAIs, 203 with osteomyelitis (OM), 158 with septic arthritis (SA), and 19 with both OM and SA, was analyzed. Thirty-five patients were admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; out of these, six suffered from shock, one needed an amputation of the right foot and of four left toes, and two had skin transplantation. According to the Pediatric Overall Performance Score, 36 (10.5%) showed a mild overall disability, 3 (0.8%) a moderate, and 1 (0.2%) a severe overall disability at discharge. A causative organism was detected in 65% (247/380) of patients. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was identified in 57.1% (141/247) of microbiological confirmed cases, including 1 (0.7%) methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 6 (4.2%) Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-producing S. aureus, followed by Group A Streptococcus (18.2%) and Kingella kingae (8.9%). K. kingae and PVL production in S. aureus were less frequently reported than expected from the literature. Conclusion: POAIs are associated with a substantial morbidity in European children, with S. aureus being the major detected pathogen. In one-third of patients, no causative organism is identified. Our observations show an urgent need for the development of a vaccine against S. aureus and for the development of new microbiologic diagnostic guidelines for POAIs in European pediatric hospitals.</td>

All the fifty-four ESBL producers were resistant to ceftazidime, while 40 (74.07%) showed resistance to cefotaxime. Percentage resistance to azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim, cefotaxime and streptomycin was 59.26 %, 64.81%, 74.07% and 75.93% respectively. Twenty-seven of the ESBL-producing isolates representing 50.00 % was resistant to oxacillin. Moreover, percentage resistance to ciprofloxacin and cefepime was 38.89% and 31.48% respectively. BlaTEM-1 had the highest percentage frequency of occurrence of 85.19% while blaCTX-M had the least value of 7.41%. The percentage occurrence for resistant gene blaSHV-2, and blaSHV-1, was 20.37%, and 5.56% respectively. The presence of ESBL bacteria in hospital wastewater shows the role played by the discharge of untreated hospital wastewater in the horizontal spread of antibiotic resistance genes. As a result, Nigeria's tradition of discharging untreated hospital effluent into the environment poses a serious threat to public health.</td>

Patients prescribed tocopherol and pentoxifylline from the pharmacy department's record database from the period of January 2019 to June 2020 were invited to take part in a semi-structured telephone survey. Sixteen patients out of a total 33 (48%) responded. 11 patients (69%) reported some issue collecting their repeat prescriptions, commonly low stock of medicines in community or unwillingness of GPs to prescribe. One patient permanently stopped treatment owing to difficulties obtaining medication, whilst for three there were temporary gaps in treatment. Difficulty in administration of the medications was reported in 7 patients (44%) patients, most commonly in those with pre-existing dysphagia. Issues related to difficulties in swallowing the large pentoxifylline tablet or with the vitamin E capsules. Patients crushed the medications, but this was associated with gastrointestinal side-effects in one patient who had to stop treatment. One patient stopped chlorhexidine mouthwash due to oral soreness. In conclusion, medical management of ORN is well tolerated by patients.

      <td>Background: Clostridium spp. spores are resistant to many factors, including alcohol-based disinfectants. The presence of clostridial spores in a hospital environment may lead to infection outbreaks among patients and health care workers. Objective: This study is aimed to detect clostridial spores in the aurology hospital using C diff Banana Broth™ and assess the antibiotic sensitivity and toxinotypes of isolates. Methods: After diagnosing COVID-19 in medical staff and closing an 86-bed urology hospital in 2020 for H(2)O(2) fogging, 58 swabs from the hospital environment were inoculated to C diff Banana Broth™, incubated at 37°C for 14 days, checked daily, and positive broths were sub-cultured anaerobically for 48 h at 37°C. After identification, multiplex PCR (mPCR) was performed for Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile toxin genes, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. Results: In this study, 16 out of 58 (~ 28%) strains of Clostridium spp. were cultured: 11-C. perfringens, 2-C. baratii, and 1 each of C. paraputrificum, C. difficile, and C. clostridioforme. 11 C. perfringens were positive for the cpa, 7-the cpb2, 2 – cpiA, and 1 – cpb toxin genes. All isolates were sensitive to metronidazole, vancomycin, moxifloxacin, penicillin/tazobactam, and rifampicin. Two out of the 11 C. perfringens strains were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. Conclusions: Regardless of the performed H(2)O(2) fogging, antibiotic-resistant, toxigenic strains of C. perfringens (69%) obtained from the urology hospital environment were cultured using C diff Banana Broth™, indicating the need to develop the necessary sanitary and epidemiological procedures in this hospital.</td>

      <td>An Unusual Etiology of Lemierre-Like Syndrome: Preseptal Cellulitis due to Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</td>
      <td>Lemierre's syndrome (LS) is a rare and potentially fatal condition that predominantly affects young adults with oropharyngeal infection. Fusobacterium necrophorum is the usual etiology and classically causes internal jugular vein septic thrombophlebitis, frequently complicated by septic emboli to several organs (most classically to the lungs). Lemierre-like syndrome (LLS) describes the same constellation of symptoms and pathophysiology as Lemierre's syndrome; however, Fusobacterium spp. are not the cause, and the source of infection may be nonoropharyngeal. We present a case with an unusual etiology of LLS: A patient with untreated preseptal cellulitis and associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia in the setting of injection drug use. Physical exam revealed tachypnea and rhonchi with severe periorbital and bilateral eyelid edema. Imaging demonstrated bilateral preseptal and orbital cellulitis with thrombosis of both internal jugular veins and bilateral pulmonary cavitary lesions consistent with septic pulmonary emboli. She was managed with anticoagulation and parenteral antibiotics. To our knowledge, this is the first case of LLS originating from preseptal cellulitis without evidence of preceding pharyngitis. While facial and orbital infections are rare etiologies of LLS, the potentially devastating sequelae of LLS warrant its inclusion in differential diagnoses.</td>

Considering the current COVID-19 pandemic, where there are no specific effective preventive or therapeutic drugs available, a healthy immune system is one of the most important tools that should be considered. Vitamins and minerals supplements have been well known to help the immune system in battling viral infections in general. Physicians worldwide are largely interested in vitamin and mineral supplements to help them battle COVID-19 whether through protection or treatment. Dietary supplementations especially vitamin D, vitamin C, and Zinc offer good prophylactic and therapeutic support to the currently available treatment regimens. They are relatively safe and were proven to aid recovery in other respiratory infections. Further studies should be encouraged especially those examining their role in prophylaxis from COVID-19 while maintaining current recommendations for social distancing and proper protective gear.</td>

We described characteristics of children hospitalized in the intensive care unit or step-down unit (ICU/SDU) who received COVID-19-directed therapies and the specific therapies administered. Methods: Between March 15, 2020 and December 27, 2020, children &lt;18 years of age in the ICU/SDU with acute COVID-19 at 48 pediatric hospitals in the United States were identified. Demographics, laboratory values, and clinical course were compared in children who did and did not receive COVID-19-directed therapies. Trends in COVID-19-directed therapies over time were evaluated. Results: Of 424 children in the ICU/SDU, 235 (55%) received COVID-19-directed therapies. Children who received COVID-19-directed therapies were older than those who did not receive COVID-19-directed therapies (13.3 [5.6-16.2] vs 9.8 [0.65-15.9] years), more had underlying medical conditions (188 [80%] vs 104 [55%]; difference = 25% [95% CI: 16% to 34%]), more received respiratory support (206 [88%] vs 71 [38%]; difference = 50% [95% CI: 34% to 56%]), and more died (8 [3.4%] vs 0). Of the 235 children receiving COVID-19-directed therapies, 172 (73%) received systemic steroids and 150 (64%) received remdesivir, with rising remdesivir use over the study period (14% in March/April to 57% November/December). Conclusion: Despite the lack of pediatric data evaluating treatments for COVID-19 in critically ill children, more than half of children requiring intensive or high acuity care received COVID-19-directed therapies.</td>

We analyzed 4821 invasive fungal isolates collected during 2018, 2019, and 2020 in 48 hospitals worldwide to evaluate the impact of this event in the occurrence and susceptibility rates of common fungal species. Isolates were tested using the CLSI broth microdilution method. While the percentage of total isolates that were C. glabrata (n = 710 isolates) or C. krusei (n = 112) slightly increased in 2020, the percentage for C. parapsilosis (n = 542), A. fumigatus (n = 416), and C. lusitaniae (n = 84) significantly decreased (P &lt;. 05). Fluconazole resistance in C. glabrata decreased from 5.8% in 2018-2019 to 2.0% in 2020, mainly due to fewer hospitals in the US having these isolates (5 vs. 1 hospital). Conversely, higher fluconazole-resistance rates were noted for C. parapsilosis (13.9 vs. 9.8%) and C. tropicalis (3.5 vs. 0.7%; P &lt;. 05) during 2020. Voriconazole resistance also increased for these species. Echinocandin resistance was unchanged among Candida spp. Voriconazole susceptibility rates in A. fumigatus were similar in these two periods (91.7% in 2018 and 2019 vs. 93.0% in 2020). Changes were also noticed in the organisms with smaller numbers of collected isolates. We observed variations in the occurrence of organisms submitted to a global surveillance and the susceptibility patterns for some organism-antifungal combinations. As the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, the impact of this event must continue to be monitored to guide treatment of patients affected by bacterial and fungal infections. Lay Summary: Secondary infections were documented in COVID-19 patients.

The aim of this multicentre study is to describe the effect of SARS-CoV-2 in SLE patients. Methods: SLE patients referring to four Italian centres were monitored between February 2020 and March 2021. All patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Disease characteristics, treatment, disease activity and SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms were recorded before and after the infection. Results: Fifty-one (6.14%) SLE patients were included among 830 who were regularly followed up. Nine (17.6%) had an asymptomatic infection and 5 (9.8%) out of 42 (82.6%) symptomatic patients developed interstitial pneumonia (no identified risk factor). The presence of SLE major organ involvement (particularly renal involvement) was associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (P = 0.02). Chronic corticosteroid therapy was found to be associated with asymptomatic infection (P = 0.018). Three SLE flares (5.9%) were developed after SARS-CoV-2 infection: one of them was characterized by MPO-ANCA-positive pauci-immune crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis and granulomatous pneumonia. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection determined autoimmune flares in a small number of patients. Our data seem to confirm that there was not an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 in SLE. Patients with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections were those having major SLE organ involvement. This may be explained by the high doses of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents used for SLE treatment.</td>

Need to travel for dialysis, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive state put them at risk of severe disease and poor outcomes. We report our experience of COVID-19 in a cohort of CKD-5D from a public sector tertiary-care center from western India. Material and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 58 CKD-5D patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our COVID-19 hospital. Suspected COVID-19, acute kidney injury (AKI), or AKI on CKD were excluded. We studied the clinical, demographic, radiological, and laboratory profiles; treatment; and outcomes of the patients. We assessed the potential clinical and laboratory parameters to predict mortality. Results: The mean age of the patients was 48.7 ± 16.9 years, with 55% males. Comorbidities included hypertension (65%), diabetes (19%), and cardiovascular disease (15.5%). The presenting features included fever (69%), respiratory distress (50%), upper respiratory symptoms (36%), and diarrhea (13%). Five (8.6%) were asymptomatic. Bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging were the commonest radiological pattern. The patients were managed with oxygenation, hydroxychloroquine, steroids, anticoagulation, remdesivir, and favipiravir. Twenty-two (37.9%) patients died, predominantly due to respiratory failure. Disease severity and C-reactive protein (CRP) above 175 mg/L at admission were the only parameters predictive of mortality. Conclusion: CKD-5D patients with COVID-19 were less likely to present with the classical syndrome of fever and respiratory distress compared with reports from the general population and had higher mortality. Only disease severity and high CRP (&gt;175 mg/L) were predictive of mortality in our cohort.</td>

      <td>Extracellular DNA may serve as marker in liquid biopsies to determine individual diagnosis and prognosis in cancer patients. Cell death or active release from various cell types, including immune cells can result in the release of DNA into the extracellular milieu. Neutrophils are important components of the innate immune system, controlling pathogens through phagocytosis and/or the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs also promote tumor progression and metastasis, by modulating angiogenesis, anti-tumor immunity, blood clotting and inflammation and providing a supportive niche for metastasizing cancer cells. Besides neutrophils, other immune cells such as eosinophils, dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, mast cells, basophils and lymphocytes can also form extracellular traps (ETs) during cancer progression, indicating possible multiple origins of extracellular DNA in cancer. In this review, we summarize the pathomechanisms of ET formation generated by different cell types, and analyze these processes in the context of cancer. We also critically discuss potential ET-inhibiting agents, which may open new therapeutic strategies for cancer prevention and treatment.</td>

In aqueous solution, γCD tends to self-assemble to form aggregates, leading to formation of both nano- and microparticles. The self-assembled γCD molecules can increase the solubility and enhance drug permeability through biological membranes, consequently improving drug bioavailability. This promising drug delivery platform is well tolerated, and it has low ocular toxicity. Clinical studies have shown that this nanocarrier can enhance topical drug delivery to both the anterior and posterior segment of the eye. The present article reviews the physicochemical properties of γCD and its derivatives, their toxicological profiles, the γCD solubilization of drugs, and methods for enhancing drug/γCD complexes and their aggregates.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness and renal safety of TAF in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who were previously treated with entecavir (ETV), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), or a nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) combination. Methods: This multicenter, retrospective, cohort study included 458 consecutive CHB patients who switched to TAF monotherapy after at least 2 years of treatment with another NA. The longitudinal virological/laboratory responses were evaluated up to 96 weeks after switchover. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Results: The proportions of complete viral suppression (CVS) (HBV DNA &lt; 20 IU/mL) at week 96 were 99.0%, 98.5%, and 98.4% in the prior ETV (n = 198), TDF (n = 137), and NA combination (n = 123) groups, respectively. Almost all patients with HBV DNA of 20–2000 IU/mL at baseline achieved CVS at week 96. On multivariable generalized estimated equation analysis, a low quantitative hepatitis surface antigen (qHBsAg) level at baseline was associated with a lower follow-up qHBsAg level (coefficient 0.81, p &lt; 0.001). The eGFR showed greater improvement in patients with CKD compared to those without (coefficient 21.7, p &lt; 0.001). However, the increase of eGFR reached a peak between weeks 24 and 48. Conclusions: Based on this longitudinal data analysis up to 96 weeks, sequential NA therapy with a switch to TAF is a good option to achieve high viral suppression and renal safety.</td>

We have analyzed and compared the phenotype and functionality of two liver cell models (Upcyte human hepatocytes and HepaRG cells) to demonstrate their suitability for long-term hepatotoxicity assessments and mechanistic studies. The transcriptomic and functional analysis revealed the maintenance of phase I and phase II enzymes, and antioxidant enzymes along time in culture, although the differences found between both test systems underlie the differential sensitivity to hepatotoxins. The evaluation of several mechanisms of cell toxicity, including oxidative stress, by high-content screening, demonstrated that, by combining the stable phenotype of liver cells and repeated-dose exposure regimes to 12 test compounds at clinically relevant concentrations, both Upcyte hepatocytes and HepaRG offer suitable properties to be used in routine screening assays for toxicological assessments during drug preclinical testing.</td>

Recent research has focused on improving azoles, our most successful class of antifungals, by looking for synergistic interactions with secondary compounds. Synergists can co-operate with azoles by targeting steps in related pathways, or they may act on mechanisms related to resistance such as active efflux or on totally disparate pathways or processes. A variety of sources of potential synergists have been explored, including pre-existing antimicrobials, pharmaceuticals approved for other uses, bioactive natural compounds and phytochemicals, and novel synthetic compounds. Synergy can successfully widen the antifungal spectrum, decrease inhibitory dosages, reduce toxicity, and prevent the development of resistance.

Further, the design and structural aspects of these multicomponent systems remain hindered compared to other techniques such as nanotechnology or solid dispersion. CC is a newer technique to modify the physicochemical as well as pharmaceutical characteristics of various drugs having issues like solubility, stability, etc. without altering or hindering their pharmacological activities. For drug delivery purpose, CC process has numerous advantages over nanotechnology and solid dispersion drug delivery techniques. CCs can modify the physicochemical properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) have issues like sensitivity toward environmental hazards like temperature, moisture, or photostability issues. The availability of large numbers of conformers makes this technique favorable for the researchers in designing CS of newer and older. Although, solid dispersion and nanotechnology techniques are being utilized to a larger extent still there are some drawbacks of these techniques like stability, toxicological factors and protection from environmental factors need to be considered, while the CCs process drastically modifies the various pharmaceutical parameters without altering the pharmacological properties of API’s.

      <td>Isolation and characterization of Escherichia albertii originated from the broiler farms in Mississippi and Alabama</td>
      <td>Escherichia albertii is an emerging foodborne enteropathogen with increasing outbreaks worldwide, particularly in Japan recently. However, major features of this zoonotic pathogen, such as prevalence, virulence, and antibiotic resistance (AR), still remain under characterized. In a recent pilot study, we reported isolation of E. albertii from a chicken farm in Tennessee, suggesting chicken is an important reservoir for E. albertii. In this large-scale study, we examined prevalence of E. albertii in 9 farms in Mississippi and Alabama. Of a total of 270 cloacal swabs (30 per farm), 43 were PCR positive and 12 E. albertii strains were isolated with different isolation rates in individual farms ranging from 0 to 23.3 %. Both PFGE and whole genome analysis showed the E. albertii from different farms were phylogenetically distant, but those from the same farm displayed clonal relationships. Consistently, the antibiogram, AR gene profiles, and plasmid replicon types were similar across the strains in the same farm. Notably, 9 of the 12 E. albertii strains displayed multidrug resistance; one strain was even resistant to imipenem, a clinically important carbapenem antibiotic. In addition, comparative genomics analysis showed that two chicken E. albertii clusters displayed very close evolutionary relationships and similar virulence gene profiles to human E. albertii strains. In vitro growth assay demonstrated that the anti-enterobactin antibodies could dramatically inhibit the growth of two representative chicken E. albertii, supporting the feasibility of the novel enterobactin-based immune intervention for controlling this emerging pathogen. Taken together, the findings from this study further indicated chickens as an important reservoir for E. albertii in the U.S., highlighting the need to prevent and control E. albertii in poultry production.</td>

      <td>Phenotypic and genotypic acyclovir resistance surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus 2 in South Africa</td>
      <td>Acyclovir (ACV) is currently included in the syndromic management algorithm for genital ulcer disease in South Africa, and is the recommended first-line treatment for herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2). In the majority of cases, HSV-2 resistance to ACV is due to amino acid changes within the viral thymidine kinase (TK). Phenotypic and genotypic ACV resistance surveillance of HSV-2 derived from genital ulcer disease swab specimens was conducted at a primary healthcare facility in Johannesburg between 2018 and 2020. The objectives of this surveillance were to identify ACV resistance-associated mutations and polymorphisms in HSV-2 TK, and to determine the phenotypic ACV resistance profiles of the corresponding clinical HSV-2 isolates. Genotypic analysis of TK from 67 HSV-2 positive genital ulcer swabs revealed 48 specimens with TK mutations, conferring 113 nucleotide changes. No resistance-associated mutations were found, however, we identified nine known natural polymorphisms (R26H, A27T, S29A, G39E, N78D, L140F, T159I, R220K and R284S) and five amino acid changes of unknown significance (R18C, G39K, M70R, P75S and L263P). Phenotypic susceptibility testing of 52 cultivable HSV-2 isolates revealed all to be susceptible to ACV with IC(50) values of &lt;2 μg/ml. The five amino acid changes of unknown significance identified by genotypic testing were not correlated to phenotypic ACV resistance, and therefore grouped as natural polymorphisms. We did not detect any unknown or resistance-associated mutations in specimens that could not be phenotypically tested for ACV resistance. Our findings will supplement existing databases of HSV antiviral resistance-associated mutations and polymorphisms that could be used for genotypic ACV resistance screening.</td>

Methods This prospective observational study was done between July 2019 and October 2020. Symptomatic patients of acute necrotic collections and walled-off necrosis of pancreas requiring drainage were included. Necrotic fluid and blood were analyzed for growth of organisms. Results Sixty-two patients were included. The mean age was 36.8 years (standard deviation, 11.5 years). Male-female ratio was 4:1. Alcohol was the most common etiology. Infection was noted in 44 of the 62 patients (70.9%) and bacteremia noted in 23 of the 62 patients (37%). Escherichia coli was the most common organism in necrotic collections and Staphylococcus was the most common organism isolated from blood culture. The patients with Modified Computed Tomography-Severity Index of 8 of higher (P &lt; 0.001) had significant association with IPN but not with bacteremia. However, splanchnic vein thrombosis (P = 0.022) was significantly associated with development of IPN as well as bacteremia on both univariate and multivariate analysis. Conclusions Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus were the most common organisms grown from necrotic collections and blood respectively. Presence of splanchnic vein thrombosis was a significant factor for development of IPN and bacteremia on univariate as well as multivariate analysis.</td>

      <td>Prophylactic Effect of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 Treatment</td>
      <td>Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 and has caused a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, named ‘coronavirus disease 2019’ (COVID-19), which has threatened human health and public safety. Objectives: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an anti-malaria drug with controversial antiviral properties. Some in vitro studies have approved its antiviral effects. Many efforts have been made to prevent and treat COVID-19, but effective drugs for complete eradication of COVID-19 have not been found yet and all available drugs are supportive. Methods: We tried to review some new aspects of HCQ efficacy in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection. Also, some data from recent clinical trials were studied. It has been shown that HCQ may improve some symptoms of patients, but in severe or critical stages, it did not have significant therapeutic effects and did not reduce the rate of mortality. Results: In this review article, we explained some results of recent studies, including clinical trials on the effects of HCQ on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection. Some studies have revealed HCQ’s beneficial effects in outpatients, and some data showed its hazardous impacts on the heart. The available evidence suggests that CQ or HCQ does not improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19. Well-designed randomized trials are required for assessing the efficacy and safety of HCQ and CQ for COVID. Conclusion: It was suggested that the dose of HCQ administration must be adjusted and monitored correctly; furthermore, the levels of some myocardial biomarkers, such as troponin must be measured in mild to moderate, severe, and critical infection. Also, combination therapy with other drugs, such as azithromycin may have better anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects</td>

      <td>Proposed Pharmacological Treatments for COVID-19: Previously Confirmed Drugs</td>
      <td>Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, also called ‘coronavirus disease 2019’ (COVID-19), first appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is caused by an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus, which has affected more than 14 million people around the world and caused a high rate of mortality. It is notable that discovering new drugs and vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is time-consuming. Therefore, reviewing drugs, which have been previously designed for other purposes can be helpful and effective. Objectives: Studying the effects of previously approved drugs is important; thus, in this article, we reviewed studies on proposed drugs against COVID-19. Methods: The articles and information were collected from Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases. We did our research based on keywords, like “therapeutics”, “pharmacology”, “Coronavirus”, “COVID-19”, “SARS”, and “MERS-CoV”. We also applied some filters, such as title/abstract, and ignored factors that could lead to bias and selective selection. Results: There is currently no cure for coronavirus, and most treatments have been effective to relieve symptoms. The treatment methods and drugs addressed in this article are chosen either from previous drugs against MERS and SARS, drugs that disrupt the life cycle of the coronavirus, or drugs that have been reviewed in retrospective studies and clinical trials. Conclusion: Prevention and treatment of COVID-19 remain a challenge, in particular for coronavirus and the treatments based on boosting the immune system and preventing virus replication. Epidemiological studies have shown that COVID-19 and SARS-COV transmission are relatively similar. This can help to select the appropriate drug. Thus, anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir are used. Antimalarial drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) along with estrogen receptor inhibitors, such as toremifene citrate, which has shown effective results against SARS and MERS, can influence the treatment process. However, more clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy and side effects of drugs</td>

      <td>Candida was the most frequently isolated yeasts species in intensive care units worldwide. While non-albicans Candida species with reduced susceptibility to antifungals have standout as an important cause of fungemia. The aim of this study was to isolate and identify Candida species from various clinical samples of inpatients in intensive care units and their susceptibility to antifungal agents. The study included 175 patients lying in the intensive care unit at Al-Sadr Teaching Hospital, Najaf, Iraq, 177 Candida species were isolated from different clinical samples and they were identified using germ tube test, Cornmeal agar, API C 20 AUX and VITEK 2 Compact Systems. Antifungal susceptibility of these isolates was determined using ATB Fungus 3 strip and VITEK 2 antifungal susceptibility cards. The results of these two methods were comparatively assessed. Results: The number and percentage of clinical samples, which Candida species isolated were 116 (65.5%) urine, 42 (24.2%) blood, 8 (4.6%) sputum, 7 (4%) endotracheal aspirate and 4 (2.3%) bed wounds. The number and percentage of isolated Candida species were 106 (59.8%) C. albicans, 32 (18%) C. tropicalis, 17 (9.6%) C. parapsilosis, 13 (7.3%) C. glabrata, 3 (1.6%) C. kefyr, 3 (1.6%) C. krusei, 2 (1.1%) C. lusitaniae and 1 (0.5%) C. famata. By VITEK 2 antifungal susceptibility cards, the overall resistant rates were 0.6% to each of amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine and 1.8% to fluconazole. In ATB Fungus 3 strips (1.8%) resistance to only fluconazole was observed. All isolates were uniformly susceptible to voriconazole in both methods. Statistically no significant difference was seen between these two methods. Regarding the susceptibility of C. albicans and non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, the latter was found to be slightly less susceptible than the former in both systems. Conclusion: Valuable information and data on distribution and susceptibility of Candida strains were obtained. These data may be valuable from epidemiological point of view as well as in proper and optimal therapy of Candida infections in Iraq.</td>

The growing emergence of these organisms' multidrug and extensively-drug resistance demonstrates the need to identify the spread of these bacteria and their resistance to the antibiotics which are used in Iraqi hospitals. Extensively drugresistant Staphylococcus aureus (XDR) is a major threat to public health worldwide. Our study was performed during the period from November 2020 to the end of January 2021. Clinical specimens (75) collected from patients suffering from different infections, who attending Baquba teaching hospital. Twenty-two isolates (29.3%) of Staphylococcus aureus have been described, with swabs of wound showing a high percentage of Staphylococcus aureus isolates (60%). Whereas, other samples were variable in percentage. Susceptibility of 22 S. aureus isolates to 15 different antibiotics has been assessed by the method of disk diffusion. The results demonstrated that all isolates resisted Methicillin, Ceftriaxone, Cloxacillin and Azetreonam. The resistance rate to Ciprofloxacin and Norfloxacin was 27.27% and 31.8%, respectively. The range of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for both of the antimicrobial drugs Ciprofloxacin and Norfloxacin was (4-1024) pg/ml. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was done by the use of specific primers that targeted specific norA gene sequences and it was shown that norA gene was detected in 100% of isolates. The quantitative real time PCR method was used to detect gene expression after extraction of RNA from isolates treated with TiO2 Nanoparticals and Ciprofloxacin. The result revealed that norA gene was highly expressed after treatment with Ciprofloxacin, while there was a low norA gene expression after treatment with TiO2NPs. Our results also demonstrated the capabiability of TiO2NPs to decrease the MIC to 2 or 4-fold when the inhibitor is present, indicating that TiO2NPs is an effective material against NorA efflux pumps.</td>

Here, we show for the first time the histologycal effect of favipiravir on the liver and kidneys using albino rats, using light microscopy, where the optical microscopic revealed that normal doses in liver showed hepatic cords arranged, normal central vein and mild sinusoildal infiltration of mono nuclear leukocytes mainly lymphocytes, the hepatocytes showed mild granular cytoplasm while double doses showed little hemorrhagic foci and disarrangement of hepatic cords. The magnified sections revealed few of hepatocytes showed mild cloudy swelling associated with little figures of cellular necrosis. As for kidneys, the optical microscopic observations showed multiple foci of hemorrhage, the magnified section revealed congestion of glomerular capillary tuft and few of renal tubules showed mild granular or vacular degeneration. On the other hand, sections of renal medulla revealed normal appearance for normal doses while renal cortex and medulla were showed marked interstitial nephritis, which characterized by interstitial thickening due to infiltration of mono nuclear leukocytes and the renal tubules showed sever vacular degeneration and necrosis for double doses. These results can guide the safe use of favipiravir and reduce the risks to tissue the liver and kidney by using double doses.</td>

The present study aimed to evaluate Fosfomycin pharmacodynamics; the elected E. coli O157:H7 isolate had been subjected to antibiotic susceptibility test, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) by utilizing of Time kill curve, Post antibiotic effect (PAE) and Mutant prevention concentration (MPC), the results showed that the E. coli O157:H7 isolate was found to be multidrug-resistant (MDR), the MIC value of Fosfomycin against E. coli O157:H7 was 2000 μg/ml, the values of MBC and MPC were 4000 μg/ml for each of them. Furthermore, time-kill analysis demonstrated that Fosfomycin exhibited the highest bactericidal effects of fosfomycin against E. coli O157:H7 was achieved after 4 hrs of posttreatment and lasted up to 24 hrs, while the post-antibiotic effect of Fosfomycin against E. coli O157: H7 was remaining for 72 min. Therefore, we report here that the Fosfomycin was strong enough to overcome of bacterial resistance to these antibiotics and has been suggested as an effective alternative and a promising antimicrobial agent for restoring the efficacy of many antibiotics against MDR E. coli O157:H7</td>

An 11-year-old girl presents with spontaneous uncontrollable movements in both arms and legs. They symptom started since one and a half months ago when the patient’s right arm and leg moved uncontrollably. The symptom started from the right leg, then the right arm started moving uncontrollably as well. About a couple of days after a week (8 days or more) after the onset of uncontrollable movements in the right leg, both arms and legs moved uncontrollably. Laboratorium results are Hb 7,9 g/dL, WBC 3.200/ìL, PLT 6.000/ìL, IPF 4,7%, Ret 0,0152×10(6)/ μL. There is also an increase in ASTO levels (505,91), increased ESR (39 mm/hour). In thorax X-ray, patient’s core seems to be enlarged. There is a right axis deviation on an EKG. Echocardipgraphy shows severe MR, modeate AR and dilatation of RV and RA. CT-scan of the head shows dextra spheinodal sinusitis. The patient underwent the therapy regiment involving: Erythromycin 500 mg/24 hours, Spironolactone 22 mg/24 hours, Lisinopril 5 mg/24 hours, Prednisone 60 mg, Haloperidol 0,8 mg/24 jam. Based on the history taking, the patient has a risk factor (age between 5-14 years-old), history of sinusitis since one year ago, and history of swallowing pain since one and half months ago which indicated a possible Streptococcus infection. On physical examination, the patient is found to have Sydenham chorea on the right extremities, speaking difficulty, sudden stop in writing when the patient is sleeping, and monoarthralgia in the joints on the plantar surface of the foot. On further examinations, the patient is found to have severe MR, moderate AR, RA and RV dilation on an echocardiography. On an EKG, the patient is to have an enlarged right heart. Other than that, the patient also has an increased ESR and indication of Streptococcus infection, which is increased ASTO.

The result showed significant decrease (P ≤ 0.05) in serum creatinine in groups treated with plant extract alone when administered as protective and as immunomodulatory. Furthermore, there were maximum depletion of serum urea levels which were significant (P ≤ 0.05) in the group treated with plant as treatment and also in the group treated with combination of plant extract with meropenem drug. Groups treated with meropenem and those treated with Rosemary extract alone (before infection), showed significant depletion in urea level in comparison to control +ve. Histopathological slides revealed vascular degeneration of most cortical renal tubules in kidney of animals (C+ group).While T1 group showed the presence of nephrosis associated with dilation of collecting tubules. In addition there were mild cloudy swelling of cortical renal tubules in animals of T(2) group. Finally normal appearance of renal cortex was noticed in kidneys of T(3) group.

The dentist community in Albania prescribing too many antibiotics. This survey assesses the mode of antibiotic use among Albanian dentists, with appropriate dosage and regimen, and antibiotic stewardship and their knowledge of relevant guidelines. Material and Methods: This survey study was conducted among 180 Albanian dentists. The questionnaire was distributed through e-mail addresses found in the database of the Faculty of Dental Medicine, University of Medicine of Tirana. We assessed 180 dentists out of which 154 (85.56%) completed the entire questionnaire. Results: There were 24,870 prescriptions in adult patients from 154 dentists for a period of six months with an average of 1,243 prescriptions per week. The most used antibiotics were fixed combinations of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (67.43%) and azithromycin (39.3%) for allergic patients to beta-lactams. The results for antibiotic stewardship were incorrect in 37.01% of total providers, and gastrointestinal disorders were reported as side effects. Conclusion: This survey conducted among Albanian dentists shows a different trend of using antibiotics than in other countries. To tackle the current antibiotic resistance, dentists must be an important part of the antimicrobial stewardship program of the Public Health Institution in Albania to change individual behavior.</td>

      <td>Aim: To investigate the microbiological quality, potential foodborne pathogen presence, and to phenotypically (antimicrobial resistance [AMR] profiles) and genotypically (DNA fingerprints and diarrhoeagenic genes) characterize Escherichia coli isolated throughout spinach production systems from farm-to-sale. Methods and Results: Samples (n = 288) were collected from two commercial supply chains using either river or borehole irrigation water. E. coli was enumerated throughout the chain where river water was directly used for overhead irrigation at levels between 0.00 and 3.22 log colony forming unit (CFU) g(−1). Following enrichment, isolation and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry identification, E. coli was isolated from 22.57% (n = 65/288) of all samples. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 3% (n = 9/288) of river and irrigation water samples on one farm, and no Listeria monocytogenes was detected throughout the study. Of the 80 characterized E. coli isolates, one harboured the stx2 virulence gene, while 43.75% (n = 35) were multidrug resistant. Overall, 26.30% of the multidrug-resistant E. coli isolates were from production scenario one that used river irrigation water, and 17.50% from the second production scenario that used borehole irrigation water. A greater percentage of resistance phenotypes were from water E. coli isolates (52.50%), than isolates from spinach (37.50%). E. coli isolates from spinach and irrigation water clustered together at high similarity values (&gt;90%) using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chan reaction analysis. Conclusions: This study reported the presence of multidrug-resistant environmental E. coli throughout spinach production from farm, during processing and up to retail. Furthermore, the similarity of multi-drug resistant E. coli isolates suggests transfer from irrigation water to spinach in both scenarios, reiterating that irrigation water for vegetables consumed raw, should comply with standardized microbiological safety guidelines. Significance and Impact of Study: Multidrug-resistant E. coli presence throughout spinach production emphasizes the necessity of increased surveillance of AMR in fresh produce and the production environment within a One Health paradigm to develop AMR mitigation strategies.</td>

      <td>Chronic pain and medical cannabis: Narrative review and practice considerations in persons living with HIV</td>
      <td>Globally, 38 million persons live with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH), and a significant portion live with chronic pain. While not yet fully characterized, preliminary data suggest 40%-83% of PLWH experience chronic pain, and many report undertreatment. A growing body of literature suggests undertreatment of chronic pain in PLWH leads to adverse clinical outcomes, such as poor retention in HIV care, suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and increased use of intravenous drug use (eg, heroin). Chronic pain experienced by PLWH ranges from neuropathic to musculoskeletal with different etiologies and treatment modalities for each. Although opioids have been used to achieve analgesia in PLWH, there is growing interest in alternative pain therapies. Recently, medical cannabis (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and cannabidiol [CBD]) products have been of high interest. Anecdotal evidence exists for medical cannabis and pain relief; however, robust clinical trial data are limited due to scheduling restrictions within the United States. The purposes of this narrative review are to summarize key literature for pain in PLWH and medical cannabis, discuss pertinent dosage forms and dosing schedules, and summarize safety and efficacy considerations for PLWH. Finally, the authors provide recommendations on cannabis rescheduling and pharmacists' and healthcare providers' roles in its prescribing and indication. Medical cannabis and pharmaceutical preparations containing both THC and CBD are a viable alternatives to opioid analgesics in the treatment of neuropathic pain in PLWH. The risks of misuse and cannabis use disorder warrant careful consideration, yet the benefits of effective analgesia associated with cannabis may outweigh these risks. Cannabis rescheduling and subsequent expansions in pain management research are warranted, particularly for CBD-predominant and CBD-isolate medical cannabis products.</td>

(2) To compare the AE cases of the GAMES cohort, with the AE cases reported in the literature since 2010. (3) To identify variables related to mortality. Methods: We recruited 10 AE cases included in the GAMES cohort (January 2008-December 2018) and 51 cases from the literature published from January 2010 to July 2019. Results: 4528 patients with infectious endocarditis (IE) were included in the GAMES cohort, of them 10 (0.2%) were AE. After comparing our 10 cases with the 51 of the literature, no differences were found. Analysing the 61 AE cases together, 55.7% were male, median age 45 years. Their main underlying conditions were as follows: prosthetic valve surgery (34.4%) and solid organ transplant (SOT) (19.7%). Mainly affecting mitral (36.1%) and aortic valve (29.5%). Main isolated species were as follows: Aspergillus fumigatus (47.5%) and Aspergillus flavus (24.6%). Embolisms occurred in 54%. Patients were treated with antifungals (90.2%), heart surgery (85.2%) or both (78.7%). Overall, 52.5% died. A greater mortality was observed in immunosuppressed patients (59.4% vs. 24.1%, OR = 4.09, 95%CI = 1.26–13.19, p =.02), and lower mortality was associated with undergoing cardiac surgery plus azole therapy (28.1% vs. 65.5%, OR = 0.22, 95%CI = 0.07–0.72, p =.01). Conclusions: AE accounts for 0.2% of all IE episodes of a national multicentric cohort, mainly affecting patients with previous valvular surgery or SOT recipients. Mortality remains high especially in immunosuppressed hosts and azole-based treatment combined with surgical resection are related to a better outcome.</td>

      <td>Silica nanoparticles (SNPs) can cause abnormal spermatogenesis in male reproductive toxicity. However, the toxicity and toxicological mechanisms of SNPs in testosterone synthesis and secretion in Leydig cells are not well known. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect and molecular mechanism of low doses of SNPs in testosterone production in Leydig cells. For this, mouse primary Leydig cells (PLCs) were exposed to 100 nm Stöber nonporous spherical SNPs. We observed significant accumulation of SNPs in the cytoplasm of PLCs via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). CCK‐8 and flow cytometry assays confirmed that low doses (50 and 100 μg/mL) of SNPs had no significant effect on cell viability and apoptosis, whereas high doses (more than 200 μg/mL) decreased cell viability and increased cell apoptosis in PLCs. Monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining showed that SNPs caused the significant accumulation of autophagosomes in the cytoplasm of PLCs. SNPs activated autophagy by upregulating microtubule‐associated protein light chain 3 (LC3‐II) and BCL‐2‐interacting protein (BECLIN‐1) levels, in addition to downregulating sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/P62) level at low doses. In addition, low doses of SNPs enhanced testosterone secretion and increased steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) expression. SNPs combined with rapamycin (RAP), an autophagy activator, enhanced testosterone production and increased StAR expression, whereas SNPs combined with 3‐methyladenine (3‐MA) and chloroquine (CQ), autophagy inhibitors, had an opposite effect. Furthermore, BECLIN‐1 depletion inhibited testosterone production and StAR expression. Altogether, our results demonstrate that low doses of SNPs enhanced testosterone secretion via the activation of autophagy in PLCs.</td>

      <td>Dual-responsive nanodroplets combined with ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction suppress tumor growth and metastasis via autophagy blockade</td>
      <td>The inhibition of autophagy is a feasible clinical strategy in tumor therapy. Traditional autophagy inhibitors are limited in clinical tumor therapy due to nonspecific biodistribution, systemic toxicity and limited antitumor effect. Herein, the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)-loaded nanodroplets (NDs) are synthesized to overcome these drawbacks. HCQ-NDs are endowed with endogenous pH- and exogenous ultrasound-responsive drug release and contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging performance. The combined application of ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) and HCQ-NDs can severely break the homeostasis of tumor cells, simultaneously releasing HCQ rapidly to block autophagic flux and thus abolish the cytoprotective function. This strategy presents strong synergistic antitumor efficacy with the tumor growth inhibition value of 80.02% and synchronously inhibits tumor lung metastasis by inhibition of MMP2 and MMP9 production, eventually leading to tumor suppression. In addition, HCQ-NDs show excellent tumor-targeting, biocompatibility, biosafety and contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging properties. Based on the above findings, this combined strategy rationally regulates the autophagic process of tumor cells and could be instructive for the design of clinical treatment modalities.</td>

      <td>Cancer cell metabolism including aerobic glycolysis, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, has been extensively studied. Metabolic reprogramming is a major hallmark of cancer, which promotes cancer cell proliferation, progression and metastasis, as well as provokes resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Several signal transduction pathways, such as BCR, MEK/ERK, Notch, NF-κB and PI3K/AKT/mTOR, regulate tumor metabolism, hence promoting tumor cell growth, proliferation and progression. Therefore, targeting metabolic enzymes, metabolites or their signal transduction pathways may constitute a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance cancer treatment efficacy. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and one-third of DLBCL patients suffer from relapsed/refractory disease after chemotherapy. The mechanisms underlying drug resistance are complex, including target gene mutations, metabolic reprogramming, aberrant signal transduction pathways, enhanced drug efflux via overexpression of multidrug efflux transporters like P-glycoprotein, upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, drug sequestration and enhanced DND repair. This review delineates the distinct metabolic reprogramming patterns and the association between metabolism and anticancer drug resistance in DLBCL as well as the emerging strategies to surmount chemoresistance in DLBCL.</td>

Data analysis was performed using the SPSS software (Version 25.0). Results: Candida spp. were isolated from a total of 116 blood samples, 60.92% of which belonged to males. The majority (43.10%) of isolates were obtained from 0-1-month-old neonates, followed by infants (16.38%) and children in the age range of 1-17 years (16.38%). Only 6.89% of isolates were obtained from adults older than 18 years. Candida tropicalis (26.72%) was the most common species, followed by Candida pelliculosa (19.83%), Candida albicans (17.24%), Candida parapsilosis (14.66%), Candida famata (9.48%), and Candida krusei (9.48%). Other isolated species included Candida lusitaniae, Candida sphaerica, and Candida inconspicua. Out of 116 isolates, 101 isolates were subjected to Vitek 2 susceptibility testing. Overall, 21.78% (22/101) of Candida isolates were found to be resistant/intermediate. Among C. albicans isolates, resistance was observed only against voriconazole (20%) and fluconazole (5%); however, among non- albicans Candida species (NAC), resistance was observed against flucytosine (16.04%), followed by fluconazole (14.81%), voriconazole (3.70%), and caspofungin (3.70%). Conclusion: Non-albicans Candida spp. predominated over Candida albicans in causing bloodstream infections and were found to be more resistant to antifungals. Continuous surveillance is necessary to monitor changes in epidemiological and resistance patterns.</td>

      <td>Antifungal activity of Taurolidine against Mucorales: An in vitro study on clinical isolates</td>
      <td>Background and Purpose: Taurolidine is active against a wide variety of micro-organisms, including bacteria and fungi. Mucormycosis is one of the life-threatening opportunistic fungal infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. Currently, the emergence of Mucormycosis during the COVID-19 pandemic raises public health concerns regarding untoward morbidity and mortality among SARS-CoV-2 patients. It is well-known that delayed and inappropriate antifungal therapy leads to increased morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to investigate the in-vitro antifungal activity of taurolidine to evaluate its effects against clinical isolates of Mucorales. Materials and Methods: This study included previously collected clinical Mucorales isolates. The minimum in vitro inhibitory concentration (MIC) of amphotericin B, caspofungin, voriconazole, posaconazole, and itraconazole was determined using the broth microdilution method. Results: All clinical isolates showed full sensitivity to amphotericin B. Posaconazole MIC range from 8 μg/mL to 0.032 μg/mL. The MIC range of voriconazole and caspofungin were determined to be 2-8 μg/mL and 0.5-16 μg/mL, respectively. Growth of the isolates was entirely inhibited in 1000 μg/mL concentration of taurolidine. In microscopic observations, morphological effects on hyphal growth were observed at 500 μg/mL concentration. Conclusion: In conclusion, this is an updated experience of using taurolidine against Mucorales. However, our in-vitro findings need to be confirmed in well-designed clinical trials aimed at treating invasive Mucormycosis infections.</td>

      <td>Metergoline is a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid identified recently as an inhibitor of the Gram-negative intracellular pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Tm). With the previously unknown antibacterial activity of metergoline, we explored structure-activity relationships (SARs) with a series of carbamate, urea, sulfonamide, amine, and amide analogues. Cinnamide and arylacrylamide derivatives show improved potency relative to metergoline against Gram-positive bacteria, and pyridine derivative 38 is also effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a murine skin infection model. Arylacrylamide analogues of metergoline show modest activity against wild-type (WT) Gram-negative bacteria but are more active against strains of efflux-deficient S. Tm and hyperpermeable Escherichia coli. The potencies against WT strains of E. coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Burkholderia cenocepacia are also improved considerably (up to &gt;128-fold) with the outer-membrane permeabilizer SPR741, suggesting that the ergot scaffold represents a new lead for the development of new antibiotics.</td>

      <td>Background: Hepatic enzymes involved in drug metabolism vary markedly in expression, abundance and activity, which affects individual susceptibility to drugs and toxicants. The present study aimed to compare mRNA expression and protein abundance of the most pharmacologically relevant drug-metabolizing enzymes in two main sources of the control liver samples that are used as the reference, i.e. organ donor livers and non-tumorous tissue from metastatic livers. An association analysis of the most common genetic variants with mRNA and protein levels was also performed. Methods: The CYP450 and UGT enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT2B7 and UGT2B15) were analyzed for mRNA (qPCR) and protein abundance (LC–MS/MS) in healthy donors (n = 11) and metastatic (n = 13) livers. Genotyping was performed by means of TaqMan assays and pyrosequencing. Results: Significantly higher protein abundance in the metastatic livers was observed in case of CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and UGT2B7, and for UGT1A3 the difference was only significant at mRNA level. For all the enzymes except CYP2E1 some significant correlation between mRNA and protein content was observed, and for UGT1A1 an inverse correlation with age was noted. CYP2C19, CYP3A5 and CYP2D6 were significantly affected by genotype. Conclusion: The selection of a control group for the study on drug-metabolizing enzymes (e.g. in pathological states) may possibly affect its conclusions on differences in mRNA and protein content. Genotyping for common functional variants of CYP450 enzymes should be performed in all studies on drug-metabolizing enzymes.</td>

      <td>Background and objectives: Corticosteroids are commonly used in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The goals of the present study were to compare the efficacy and safety of different doses of dexamethasone in the treatment of patients with a diagnosis of moderate to severe COVID-19. Methods: Hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of moderate to severe COVID-19 were assigned to intravenous low-dose (8 mg once daily), intermediate-dose (8 mg twice daily) or high-dose (8 mg thrice daily) dexamethasone for up to 10 days or until hospital discharge. Clinical response, 60-day survival and adverse effects were the main outcomes of the study. Results: In the competing risk survival analysis, patients in the low-dose group had a higher clinical response than the high-dose group when considering death as a competing risk (HR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.23–3.33, p = 0.03). Also, the survival was significantly longer in the low-dose group than the high-dose group (HR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.15–0.83, p = 0.02). Leukocytosis and hyperglycemia were the most common side effects of dexamethasone. Although the incidence was not significantly different between the groups, some adverse effects were numerically higher in the intermediate-dose and high-dose groups than in the low-dose group. Conclusions: Higher doses of dexamethasone not only failed to improve efficacy but also resulted in an increase in the number of adverse events and worsen survival in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 compared to the low-dose dexamethasone.

      <td>Nowadays, it's imperative to develop novel antimicrobial agents active against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant bacterial infections with favorable profiles as high efficacy, low toxicity, and short therapy duration. Accordingly, a series of new thiazolo-indolin-2-one derivatives were synthesized based on acid and base catalyzed condensation or reaction of thiosemicarbazone 8 with different electrophilic reagents. The structure of the new compounds was confirmed based on elemental analysis and spectral data. Based on the MIC results, the most active thiazolo-indoline derivatives 2, 4, 7a, and 12 exhibited promising antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with weak to moderate antifungal activities. Surprisingly, the N-(thiazol-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide derivative 4 was found to be most active on antibiofilm activity against both S. aureus (ATCC 29213) with BIC(50) (1.95 ± 0.01 µg/mL), while 5-(2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)-thiazol-4(5H)-one derivative 7a exhibited the strongest antibiofilm activity against P. aeruginosa pathogens with BIC(50) (3.9 ± 0.16 µg/mL). Further, the thiazole derivatives 2, 4 and 12 exhibited a significant inhibition activity against the fsr system in a dose-dependent manner without affecting bacterial growth. The target derivatives behaved synergistic and additively effect against MDR p. aeruginosa, and thiazole derivative 12 exhibited a high synergistic effect with most tested antibiotics except Cefepime with FIC value ranging between 0.249 and 1.0, reducing their MICs. Interestingly, the 3-(2-(4-thiazol-2-yl)hydrazono)indolin-2-one derivative 12 displayed the highest selectivity to DHFR inhibitory with IC(50) value 40.71 ± 1.86 nM superior to those of the reference Methotrexate. Finally, in silico molecular modeling simulation, some physicochemical properties and toxicity predictions were performed for the most active derivatives.</td>

Symptoms amplified with Valsalva, corticosteroids, and postlumbar puncture, with longitudinally extensive midthoracic T2-hyperintense lesion extending to the conus associated with hazy holocord enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), raising suspicion for spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (sDAVF). Initial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was negative for sDAVF. However, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 positive, and he was treated with antiviral therapy. Unfortunately, he continued to worsen despite treatment. Repeat neuroimaging 12 months after initial presentation demonstrated persistent lower thoracic/conus lesion in addition to cauda equina enhancement and subtle dorsal T2-hypointense flow voids. We raised red flags (e.g., lack of clinical prodrome, no herpetic rash, no CSF pleocytosis, and rostral extent of the lesion) that suggested the HSV2 nucleic acid detection was perhaps unrelated to the neurologic syndrome. Given the high index of suspicion for sDAVF, we repeated spinal vascular imaging. Spinal MRA demonstrated dilated right dorsal perimedullary veins from T10 to T11. Repeat DSA revealed a right T10 sDAVF. Microsurgical treatment rather than embolization of the fistula was successful without complication, with significant improvement in motor, sphincter, and to a lesser extent sensory function, with residual gait imbalance after inpatient rehabilitation 3 weeks postoperatively.</td>

      <td>Background During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was great enthusiasm for the use of azithromycin with or without hydroxychloroquine. Objectives We analyzed azithromycin consumption in Croatia in 2020 and compared this to the period 2017-2019. Methods Azithromycin consumption was evaluated using the IQVIA Adriatic d.o.o. database which collects data on azithromycin distribution from wholesale pharmacies to hospital and nonhospital pharmacies in Croatia. We analyzed data for the period from January 2017 to December 2020. Azithromycin distribution was measured as days of therapy (DOT) and reported as per 1000 inhabitants or per 1000 inhabitant-days. Results In the period 2017-2020, total azithromycin DOT in Croatia increased in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 (1.76, 1.91, 1.91 and 2.01/1000 inhabitant-days, respectively). Non-hospital pharmacies received 2.18 times and hospital pharmacies 4.39 times more DOT units/1000 inhabitants of azithromycin in March 2020 compared to the average distribution rate in March 2017-2019. During the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic (November and December 2020) azithromycin distribution increased considerably in hospital (3.62 and 3.19 times, respectively) and non-hospital pharmacies (1.93 and 1.84 times, respectively) compared to the average consumption in the same months in 2017-2019. Conclusions Our data showed increased azithromycin distribution in the period 2017-2020 which indicates azithromycin overuse. Preliminary information on COVID-19 treatments with a desire to offer and try what is available even in the absence of strong scientific evidence may have influenced practices of antimicrobial prescriptions.</td>

      <td>The rapid emergence of virulent and multidrug-resistant (MDR) non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) enterica serovars is a growing public health concern globally. The present study focused on the assessment of the pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling of NTS enterica serovars isolated from the chicken processing environments at wet markets in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A total of 870 samples consisting of carcass dressing water (CDW), chopping board swabs (CBS), and knife swabs (KS) were collected from 29 wet markets. The prevalence of Salmonella was found to be 20% in CDW, 19.31% in CBS, and 17.58% in KS, respectively. Meanwhile, the MDR Salmonella was found to be 72.41%, 73.21%, and 68.62% in CDW, CBS, and KS, respectively. All isolates were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for eight virulence genes, namely invA, agfA, IpfA, hilA, sivH, sefA, sopE, and spvC. The S. Enteritidis and untyped Salmonella isolates harbored all virulence genes while S. Typhimurium isolates carried six virulence genes, except sefA and spvC. Phenotypic resistance revealed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and azithromycin. Genotypic resistance showed a higher prevalence of plasmid-mediated blaTEM followed by tetA, sul1, sul2, sul3, and strA/B genes. The phenotypic and genotypic resistance profiles of the isolates showed a harmonic and symmetrical trend. According to the findings, MDR and virulent NTS enterica serovars predominate in wet market conditions and can easily enter the human food chain. The chi-square analysis showed significantly higher associations among the phenotypic resistance, genotypic resistance and virulence genes in CDW, CBS, and KS respectively (p &lt; 0.05).</td>

Their unprecedented epidemic rate and unpredictable clinical features underscore an urgent need for antiviral interventions. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a natural occurring adrenal-derived steroid in the human body that has been associated in protection against various infections. In the present study, the plaque assay based primary screening was conducted on 32 synthetic derivatives of DHEA against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) to identify potent anti-flaviviral compounds. Based on primary screening, HAAS-AV3026 and HAAS-AV3027 were selected as hits from DHEA derivatives that exhibited strong antiviral activity against JEV (IC(50) ​= ​2.13 and 1.98 ​μmol/L, respectively) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (IC(50) ​= ​3.73 and 3.42 ​μmol/L, respectively). Mechanism study indicates that HAAS-AV3026 and HAAS-AV3027 do not exhibit inhibitory effect on flavivirus binding and entry process, while significantly inhibit flavivirus infection at the replication stage. Moreover, indirect immunofluorescence assay, Western blot analyses, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed a potent antiviral activity of DHEA derivatives hits against JEV and ZIKV in terms of inhibition of viral infection, protein production, and viral RNA synthesis in Vero cells. Taken together, our results may provide a basis for the development of new antivirals against flaviviruses.</td>

The emergence of antibiotic resistance is a significant health problem and cancer patients are at risk of repeated infections with drug-resistant bacteria. Objective: This investigation aimed to identify predictors of repeat infections of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and drug resistance in cancer patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Upper Egypt. Methods: Blood, urine, sputum, pus, and mouth and nose swabs were collected from patients at the Pediatric Oncology and Medical Oncology ICUs during the period from February 2017 to May 2018. The samples were assessed by antibiotic susceptibility test and further evaluated by genetic testing for the temoniera (TEM) gene of β-lactamase. Samples positive for K. pneumoniae and E. coli were included and isolates positive for other microorganisms were excluded. Results: The study included 107 patients with malignant neoplasms and 136 samples. Repeated infection with K. pneumoniae and E. coli occurred in 31% and 22.45% of patients, respectively. Patients who stayed for a longer period in the ICU were more likely to have repeated infections (OR 1.25, 95%CI 1.10-1.44, p=0.001) after control of other confounding factors. The type of malignant neoplasm, whether it was a hematologic or solid tumor (OR 7.46, 95% CI 2.56-21.7, p=0.0002) and a longer prior stay in the ICU (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02-1.28, p=0.025) remained the independent predictors for the drug resistance in the last infection. The TEM type of β-lactamase was encoded in 48.68% and 66.67% of K. pneumoniae and E. coli, respectively. Conclusion: Reinfection with K. pneumoniae and E. coli in patients with cancer can occur as the number of days in the hospital increases. Total prior days spent in the ICU by cancer patients were independently associated with both repeated infections and drug resistance. Samples from patients with hematologic neoplasms were associated with drug resistance.</td>

Predictions are showing that these trends will continue to rise in the upcoming years. Summary: Alcohol-related liver disease, nonalcohol fatty liver disease, and viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C are the leading causes of liver cirrhosis and primary liver cancer in Europe. Drug-induced liver injury represents a major cause of acute hepatitis, while liver transplantation is the second most common solid organ transplantation in the world. Patients with CLD have increasing rates of hospitalization, longer hospital stays, and more adverse outcomes compared to the other chronic conditions. Direct targeting of risk factors can prevent complications of advanced liver disease and improve outcome. Patients with CLD should be referred to a hepatologist for assessment of the stage of liver disease, for specific treatment and screening for hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, patients with unknown etiology of abnormal liver blood tests should be referred to a hepatologist for assessment of liver disease, as well as for prevention and treatment of complications of cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension. Key Messages: CLD is amenable to prevention and treatment, while disease management strategies need to improve in order to reduce the burden of liver disease and deaths due to end-stage liver diseases.</td>

The mortality rate of encephalitis can be decreased by early diagnosis and treatment. Here, we present a case of a 71-year-old woman who was hospitalized with the symptoms of confusion and fever and was found to be COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive by both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and nasopharyngeal swab analysis. The patient underwent transsphenoidal pituitary surgery 4 months before her admission and was in an acute confusional state accompanied with consciousness fluctuations and agitation. On magentic resonance imaging, the hyperintensities detected in the T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery axial sections of the bilateral temporal brain areas and paramedian region of pons were observed to be compatible with encephalitis. The nasopharyngeal and CSF severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA) PCR was performed because the thorax computed tomography revealed findings compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia and both the samples were found to be PCR-positive. Encephalitis arising from toxic and metabolic causes was excluded. In this case, the COVID-19-associated encephalitis was treated with dual antiviral (favipiravir and acyclovir) and steroid therapies. This case was considered unique as very few cases of positive nasopharyngeal and CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR have been reported and because of the patient's history of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery 4 months before her hospitalization.</td>

      <td>Production of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) in bacterial pathogens is an important cause of resistance to the ‘last-resort’ carbapenem antibiotics. Development of effective MBL inhibitors to reverse carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is still needed. We herein report X-ray structure-guided optimization of 1H-imidazole-2-carboxylic acid (ICA) derivatives by considering how to engage with the active-site flexible loops and improve penetration into Gram-negative bacteria. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed the importance of appropriate substituents at ICA 1-position to achieve potent inhibition to class B1 MBLs, particularly the Verona Integron-encoded MBLs (VIMs), mainly by involving ingenious interactions with the flexible active site loops as observed by crystallographic analyses. Of the tested ICA inhibitors, 55 displayed potent synergistic antibacterial activity with meropenem against engineered Escherichia coli strains and even intractable clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa producing VIM-2 MBL. The morphologic and internal structural changes of bacterial cells after treatment further demonstrated that 55 crossed the outer membrane and reversed the activity of meropenem. Moreover, 55 showed good pharmacokinetic and safety profile in vivo, which could be a potential candidate for combating VIM-mediated Gram-negative carbapenem resistance.</td>

      <td>Case Report: Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis—An Unusual Long-Term Complication of Lung Cancer Treatment</td>
      <td>Background: Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is a rare complication of radiochemotherapy for lung cancer. It may develop months or years after radical treatment. The diagnosis of CPA is challenging and complex. Not only fungal infection but also cancer relapse always have to be taken under consideration. Antifungal therapy is the base treatment, especially in the case when a surgical procedure is not possible. Standard treatment for at least 6 months is recommended but the optimal duration of the antifungal therapy is unknown. We present the clinical case of CPA, in which we had to perform multidirectional diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis and modified treatment due to the recurrence of the disease. Case Presentation: We report a patient who developed CPA three and a half years after concurrent radiochemotherapy for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Non-specific symptoms were the cause of delayed diagnosis of fungal infection. Samples collected during bronchoscopy allowed to exclude the recurrence of lung cancer and establish the diagnosis of CPA. The patient was treated with itraconazole for 6 months. A few months later, controlled chest CT scans revealed the progression of CPA. Initially, retreatment with itraconazole was implemented. Due to the progression of fungal infection, voriconazole was used in the second line of treatment. Unfortunately, this therapy was complicated by the side effects and deterioration of the patient's condition. The reintroduction of itraconazole resulted in clinical and radiological improvement. Treatment is scheduled for at least 12 months. Conclusion: Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) was the cause of clinical deterioration and radiological progression in a patient after the radical treatment of lung cancer. In the described case, the diagnosis of CPA was delayed because of the suspicion of the recurrence of lung cancer. As the surgery was not possible, antifungal therapy with itraconazole was implemented and the proper dosage and duration led to significant clinical improvement.</td>

      <td>A sudden outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 has now emerged as a pandemic threatening to efface the existence of mankind. In absence of any valid and appropriate vaccines to combat this newly evolved agent, there is need of novel resource molecules for treatment and prophylaxis. To this effect, flavonol morin which is found in fruits, vegetables and various medicinal herbs has been evaluated for its antiviral potential in the present study. PASS analysis of morin versus reference antiviral drugs baricitinib, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine revealed that morin displayed no violations of Lipinski’s rule of five and other druglikeness filters. Morin also displayed no tumorigenic, reproductive or irritant effects and exhibited good absorption and permeation through GI (clogP &lt;5). In principal component analysis, morin appeared closest to baricitinib in 3D space. Morin displayed potent binding to spike glycoprotein, main protease 3CLPro and papain-like protease PLPro of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using molecular docking and significant binding to three viral-specific host proteins viz. human ACE2, importin-α and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1, further lending support to its antiviral efficacy. Additionally, morin displayed potent binding to pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, 8 and 10 also supporting its anti-inflammatory activity. MD simulation of morin with SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro and PLPro displayed strong stability at 300 K. Both complexes exhibited constant RMSDs of protein side chains and Cα atoms throughout the simulation run time. In conclusion, morin might hold considerable therapeutic potential for the treatment and management of not only COVID-19, but also SARS and MERS if studied further. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

      <td>Background: This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive bacteria in infants. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of infants aged &lt; 1 year with first UTI from 2018 to 2019 at two tertiary centers in Korea. Data analyzed included clinical findings, birth history, delivery mode, milk type, use of postpartum care center, and previous use of antibiotics both in the patient and mother. Results: Of 265 patients, 62 (23.4%) were diagnosed with first UTI caused by ESBL-positive bacteria at the median age of 3.6 (interquartile range (IQR) 2.3–5.4) months. Maternal use of antibiotics during pregnancy (29.0 vs. 10.3%, p &lt; 0.001) and Klebsiella species (19.4% vs. 4.9%, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with ESBL-positive UTIs and remained valid in the multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR], 3.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61–7.19, p = 0.001, and OR 5.26; 95% CI 2.03–13.13, p = 0.001, respectively). Previous antibiotic exposure of patients, previous hospitalization, prematurity, delivery mode, milk type, and use of postpartum care center were not significantly different between ESBL-positive and ESBL-negative groups. With respect to the clinical course of UTI, the ESBL-positive group presented a higher number of blood leukocytes (p = 0.041) and longer hospital stay (p &lt; 0.001) than the ESBL-negative group. Conclusions: About one-fourth of infantile UTI cases were ESBL-positive. Prenatal antibiotic exposure of mothers and Klebsiella species were associated with community-acquired UTI caused by ESBL-positive bacteria.

      <td>Objective: The impact of asthma as a possible risk factor for adverse clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of asthma on adverse clinical outcomes in a COVID-19 hospitalized cohort. Methods: Retrospective, propensity-matched observational study of consecutive COVID-19-positive patients between February 24, 2020, and November 3, 2020 at a single health care system. Results: In the initial population of 1925 patients, 4.4% presented with asthma. Propensity score matching reduced the total sample to n = 1045: 88 (8.4%) with asthma and n = 957 without asthma. A total of 164 (15.7%) patients died during the hospitalization, including 7 (8.0%) in the asthma group and 157 (16.4%), p =.037, in the non-asthmatic cohort. There was no difference between these groups in need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay on a ventilator, or hospital length of stay. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that asthma was an independent predictor of lower mortality, while older age, BMI &gt; 30 kg/m(2), heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and admission National Early Warning Score (NEWS) were significantly associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. There were no significant differences between asthmatic and non-asthmatic cohorts with respect to need for mechanical ventilation, length of mechanical ventilation, serum markers of severe COVID-19 disease, or overall length of hospital stay. Conclusion: We conclude that asthma in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is associated with a lower risk of mortality and no increase in disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.</td>

      <td>Safety considerations with new antibacterial approaches for chronic bacterial prostatitis</td>
      <td>Introduction: Chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) is a difficult-to-eradicate infection. Antibacterial therapy with currently licensed agents is hindered due to the increasing emergence of pathogen resistance worldwide and to frequent infection relapse. With limited treatment options, physicians are investigating new agents, which, however, may raise safety concerns. Areas covered: Antibacterial agents currently licensed for CBP were not considered. Available reports about the safety and efficacy of antibacterial agents that have been clinically tested or tentatively used to treat CBP in single cases were evaluated. This review also focused on agents targeting Gram-positive pathogens, whose prevalence as causative agents of CBP is increasing. Expert opinion: (i) Most antibacterial agents considered in this review have been administered off-label in the interest of patients, and their use requires particular caution. (ii) Reports describing the usage of many of the drugs reviewed here are still scant, and readers should be warned of the limited published evidence supporting therapy for CBP with these agents. (iii) As treatment must extend over several weeks, medium-term adverse events may occur and therapy should be individualized, taking into account the dosage and the potential toxicity of each specific antibiotic. Regarding dangerous drug–drug interactions, particular attention should be paid to the risk of ECG-QT-interval elongation.</td>

      <td>Objectives: To compare the effect of treat-to-target-based escalations in conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and biologics on clinical disease activity and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inflammation in a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cohort in clinical remission. Method: One-hundred patients with established RA, Disease Activity Score based on 28-joint count–C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) &lt; 3.2, and no swollen joints (hereafter referred to as ‘in clinical remission’) who received csDMARDs underwent clinical evaluation and MRI of the wrist and second to fifth metacarpophalangeal joints every 4 months. They followed a 2 year MRI treatment strategy targeting DAS28-CRP ≤ 3.2, no swollen joints, and absence of MRI osteitis, with predefined algorithmic treatment escalation: first: increase in csDMARDs; second: adding a biologic; third: switch biologic. MRI osteitis and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) (co-primary outcomes) and MRI combined inflammation and Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) (key secondary outcomes) were assessed 4 months after treatment change and expressed as estimates of group differences. Statistical analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population analysed using repeated-measures mixed models. Results: Escalation to first biologic compared to csDMARD escalation more effectively reduced MRI osteitis (difference between least squares means 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.0–2.6), HAQ score (0.08, 0.03–0.1), MRI combined inflammation (2.5, 0.9–4.1), and SDAI scores (2.7, 1.9–3.5). Conclusions: Treat-to-target-based treatment escalations to biologics compared to escalation in csDMARDs more effectively improved MRI inflammation, physical function, and clinical disease activity in patients with established RA in clinical remission. Treatment escalation in RA patients in clinical remission reduces clinical and MRI-assessed disease activity. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01656278.</td>

      <td>Background: To assess the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients compared with standard care or placebo. Methods: Electronic databases were searched to identify relevant studies. The mortality, adverse events, and other data from studies were pooled for statistical analysis. Results: Ten randomized clinical trials were eligible for inclusion. Corticosteroid treatment in COVID-19 patients did not significantly reduce the risk of death (RR: 0.93; CI: 0.82, 1.05) and the need for mechanical ventilation (RR: 0.82; CI: 0.62, 1.08). No mortality reduction was also observed in the subgroup of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (RR: 0.90; CI: 0.79–1.03). The use of corticosteroids increased mortality in the subgroup of patients not requiring oxygen support (RR: 1.24; CI: 1.00–1.55). The survival benefit was observed in a low dosage of corticosteroids (RR: 0.90; CI: 0.84–0.97) and dexamethasone (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.79–1.04). There was no difference in the rates of adverse events (RR: 1.13; CI: 0.58, 2.20) and secondary infections (RR: 0.87; CI: 0.66, 1.15). Conclusion: Corticosteroid treatment did not convincingly improve survival in severe COVID-19 patients. Low-dose dexamethasone could be considered as a drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. More high-quality trials are needed to further verify this conclusion. Expert Opinion: The effect of corticosteroids on patient survival highly depended on the selection of the right dosage and type and in a specific subgroup of patients. This meta-analysis, which included more RCTs, evaluated the safety and efficacy in severe COVID-19 patients and analyzed the effects of different types of corticosteroid treatments. Corticosteroid treatment did not convincingly improve survival in severe COVID-19 patients. But the low dose dexamethasone appear to have a role in the management of severe COVID-19 patients.</td>

      <td>Introduction: Gordonia species, aerobic, weakly acid-fast, Gram-positive bacilli, are a rare cause of peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). We report the first pediatric case of PD-related peritonitis caused by Gordonia bronchialis. Case presentation: A 13-year-old girl with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5D, on continuous cycling PD (CCPD) for 8 years, presented with cloudy PD effluent, with no abdominal discomfort or fever. Intra-peritoneal (IP) loading doses of vancomycin and ceftazidime were started at home after obtaining a PD effluent sample, which showed WBC 2,340 × 10 /L (59% neutrophils) and Gram-positive bacilli. On admission, she was clinically well and afebrile, with no history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, so vancomycin was discontinued, and IP ceftazidime and cefazolin were started, following a loading dose of intravenous cefazolin. Gordonia species grew after 5 days of incubation and later identified as Gordonia bronchialis. IP vancomycin was restarted as monotherapy, empirically for a total of 3 weeks therapy. A 2-week course of oral ciprofloxacin was added, based on susceptibility testing. PD catheter replacement was advised due to the risk of recurrence but was refused. A relapse occurred 16 days after discontinuing antibiotics, successfully treated with a 2-week course of IP ceftazidime and vancomycin. The PD catheter was removed and hemodialysis initiated. She received a further 2-week course of oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate post PD catheter removal. Conclusions: Gordonia bronchialis is an emerging pathogen in PD peritonitis and appears to be associated with a high risk of relapse. PD catheter replacement is strongly suggested.</td>

      <td>After an injury, the wounds need to be covered with a dressing. Lack of absorptive potential and sticking of dressing with the wound causes pain and slows the healing process. The aim of this study was to develop wound dressings having more absorptive potential and less sticking with the wound. The hemicelluloses from Lallemantia royleana seeds possess desirable properties for a wound dressing. The hemicellulose was blended with chitosan/chitin and glutaraldehyde to enhance the absorptive properties of the hemicellulose through cross-linking. Two types of formulations incorporating silver nanoparticles and ciprofloxacin were prepared. The composites were characterized by elemental analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive). The dressings were subjected to in vivo studies on Albino rats. The dressings were found to be porous and the silver nanoparticles and drug particles were found to be uniformly distributed in the polymeric matrix. The composite containing ciprofloxacin released the drug in a sustained manner for 14–16 days. From extrapolation of the data, it was discovered that the formulation would release around 80% of ciprofloxacin in about two weeks. Silver-ciprofloxacin nano-composites exhibited comparable activity (zone of inhibition 19–30 mm) against E. coli to that of ciprofloxacin (standard, 21–35 mm) and relatively lower activity in case of S. aureus (zone of inhabitation 11–17 mm). The dressings did not stick to the wound site and the site remained wet during the healing process. Thus the use of hemicellulose from L. royleana seeds proved to be beneficial for preparing wound dressings with improved properties because of having high swelling index, porosity and spongy texture.</td>

      <td>Background: Quinolones comprise a class of antibiotics that are globally preferred for treating a wide range of bacterial infections due to their potency, broad coverage, favorable pharmacologic profile, and mostly mild to moderate adverse reactions. Spontaneous reports on adverse drug events (ADE) and data from some pharmacoepidemiologic studies have raised concerns regarding quinolones and risk of retinal detachment (RD). This study examined ADE reports submitted to FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) for evidence on quinolone-associated RD risk. Research design and methods: We identified all RD reports in FAERS between 2010–2019. We compared ADE signals between quinolones and selected medications that were previously associated with RD, and with reference medications not known to cause RD. For signal detection, we used two techniques: the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), which are known for their higher sensitivity and specificity for ADE signal detection, respectively. Results: Moxifloxacin showed a positive and significant PRR signal for RD [PRR: 2.54 (1.60, 4.04)], and a marginally significant EBGM signal [EBGM: 2.21 (1.41, 3.02)]. Conclusion: Moxifloxacin is the only quinolone showing a positive disproportionality signal for RD. Further epidemiologic research is needed to clarify the association between moxifloxacin and RD risk.</td>

      <td>Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have recently been developed to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and interferon-free DAA treatment has improved liver function of HCV patients. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence following HCV eradication has been previously reported, but HCC may have been missed following imaging diagnosis before DAA administration in previous studies. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify definite predictors of HCC occurrence ≥1 year after DAA treatment. Among 956 patients receiving DAAs for HCV infection, 567 patients who achieved sustained virologic response with no history of HCC treatment were enrolled in this study between September 2014 and July 2021. The incidence of HCC in HCV-infected patients ≥1 year following DAA treatment, and the predictors contributing to HCC occurrence were identified using clinical characteristics and blood test results. In the present study, 25 patients developed HCC. The incidence of HCC was 1.4%, 3.2%, 4.9% and 6.8% at 2, 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively, from the end of treatment with DAAs. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed serum α-fetoprotein level at end of treatment (EOT-AFP) &gt;3.8 ng/ml ≥1 year following treatment with DAAs (HR, 9.7; p &lt;.0001) as an independent factor that may contribute to HCC occurrence following DAA treatment. In conclusion, serum EOT-AFP level may serve an important role in determining the risk of HCC occurrence ≥1 year after DAA treatment. Regular examinations are required even if serum EOT-AFP level is low at treatment completion.</td>

      <td>Despite having adequate solubility properties, bioequivalence (BE) studies performed on immediate release formulations containing BCS1/3 drugs occasionally fail. By systematically evaluating a set of 17 soluble drugs where unexpected BE failures have been reported and comparing to a set of 29 drugs where no such reports have been documented, a broad assessment of the risk factors leading to BE failure was performed. BE failures for BCS1/3 drugs were predominantly related to changes in C(max) rather than AUC. C(max) changes were typically modest, with minimal clinical significance for most drugs. Overall, drugs with a sharp plasma peak were identified as a key factor in BE failure risk. A new pharmacokinetic term (t½C(max)) is proposed to identify drugs at higher risk due to their peak plasma profile shape. In addition, the analysis revealed that weak acids, and drugs with particularly high gastric solubility are potentially more vulnerable to BE failure, particularly when these features are combined with a sharp C(max) peak. BCS3 drugs, which are often characterised as being more vulnerable to BE failure due to their potential for permeation and transit to be altered, particularly by excipient change, were not in general at greater risk of BE failures. These findings will help to inform how biowaivers may be optimally applied in the future.</td>

However, the complex nature of the structural characteristics of the lungs often results in the difficulty in the development of lung inhalation preparations. Nanocrystals technology provides a potential formulation strategy for the pulmonary delivery of poorly soluble drugs, owing to the decreased particle size of drug, which is a potential approach to overcome the physiological barrier existing in the lungs and significantly increased bioavailability of drugs. The pulmonary inhalation administration has attracted considerable attentions in recent years. This review discusses the barriers for pulmonary drug delivery and the recent advance of the nanocrystals in pulmonary inhalation delivery. The presence of nanocrystals opens up new prospects for the development of novel pulmonary delivery system.

Methods: All patients admitted with echinococcosis between January 2000 and December 2020 were identified. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively concerning patient demographics, treatment strategy, surgical procedures, complications and outcomes. Results: A total of 92 patients with median age 37 years (range 4-85) were identified. Sixty-eight patients (74%) were symptomatic. All patients, except for two, were immigrants to Norway and born in endemic areas. Ninety patients were diagnosed with CE and two with AE. Location of the cysts was most commonly in the liver (86%) followed by peritoneum, lungs, and spleen. All patients with active cysts were treated with albendazole. Surgical treatment was performed in 51 (56%) patients. The most common reason for abstaining from surgical treatment was that the diagnostic work-up revealed inactive cysts or interventional radiology was performed. Of the 51 patients who underwent surgery, a radical procedure was performed in 32 (64%) cases, a conservative procedure in 12 (24%), and a combination in six (12%). Clavien Dindo grade ≥3 complications occurred in 30%, and 90-day mortality was 2%. Bile leakage occurred in seven patients and was treated successfully with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with biliary stent placement in all patients. Conclusion: In a low-endemic area like Norway, management of echinococcus includes medical therapy, surgery, and/or interventional radiology. Surgical intervention seems to be effective, and is associated with acceptable morbidity rates.</td>

      <td>Pannexin1 inhibits autophagy of cisplatin-resistant testicular cancer cells by mediating ATP release</td>
      <td>Pannexin1 (Panx-1) is a gap junction channel protein that mediates the release of intracellular ATP during autophagy, and thus plays an important role in tumor cell apoptosis and chemo-resistance. However, the role of Panx-1 in cisplatin-resistance of testicular cancer cells remains unclear. We found that cisplatin-resistant I-10 testicular cancer cell lines (I-10/CDDP) autophagy-associated proteins (p62, p-mTOR, mTOR and LC3) exhibited high levels of autophagy in their expression, while LC3-II expression was more significantly in the presence of lysosomal degradation blocked by chloroquine (CQ). Xenograft models using I-10/CDDP cells with knockdown ATG5 and ATG7 were established in mouse models and showed blockade of autophagic flux and inhibition of tumor growth. In addition, inhibition of Panx-1 by carbenoxolone (CBX) and probenecid (PBN), as well as shRNA-mediated knockdown promoted autophagy in the I-10/CDDP cells, which was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of extracellular ATP. In contrast, overexpression of Panx-1 decreased autophagy of I-10/CDDP cells and increased extracellular ATP levels. To further determine the effect of panx-1-mediated ATP release on the autophagy of I-10/CDDP cells, apyrase was used to hydrolyze the extracellular ATP. Apyrase promoted autophagy in I-10/CDDP cells city by decreasing extracellular ATP, regardless of Panx-1 expression. This study demonstrated for the first time that Panx-1-mediated ATP release inhibits autophagy of I-10/CDDP cells, which provides a potential therapeutic strategy for cisplatin-resistant testicular cancer.</td>

      <td>Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common hemoglobinopathy in the world. Over 90% of those born with SCD live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet individuals in these settings have much poorer outcomes compared to those in high-income countries. Areas Covered: This manuscript provides an in-depth review of the cornerstones of basic SCD care, the barriers to implementing these in LMICs, and strategies to increase access in these regions. Publications in English language, peer-reviewed, and edited from 2000 to 2021 were identified on PubMed. Google search was used for gray literature. Expert Opinion: Outcomes for patients with SCD in high-income countries have improved over the last few decades due to the implementation of universal newborn screening programs and use of routine antimicrobial prophylaxis, increase in therapeutic and curative options, and the adoption of specific measures to decrease risk of stroke. This success has not translated to LMICs due to several reasons including resource constraints. A combination of several strategies is needed to increase access to basic SCD care for patients in these settings.</td>

      <td>This article describes the synthesis and antiviral activity evaluation of new substituted 1,2,4-oxadiazoles containing a bicyclic substituent at position 5 of the heterocycle and O-acylated amidoximes as precursors for their synthesis. New compounds were obtained from the (+)-camphor derivative (+)-ketopinic acid. The chemical library was tested in vitro for cytotoxicity against the MDCK cell line and for antiviral activity against influenza viruses of H1N1 and H7N9 subtypes. The synthesised compounds exhibited high virus-inhibiting activity against the H1N1 influenza virus. Some synthesised compounds were also active against the influenza virus of a different antigenic subtype: H7N9. The mechanism of the virus-inhibiting activity of these compounds is based on their interference with the fusion activity of viral hemagglutinin (HA). No interference with the receptor-binding activity of HA has been demonstrated. According to molecular docking results, the selective antiviral activity of O-acylated amidoximes and 1,2,4-oxadiazoles is associated with their structural features. O-Acylated amidoximes are likely more complementary to the binding site located at the site of the fusion peptide, and 1,2,4-oxadiazoles are more complimentary to the site located at the site of proteolysis. Significant differences in the amino acid residues of the binding sites of HA's of different types allow us to explain the selective antiviral activity of the compounds under study.</td>

The purpose of this study was to identify the molecular characteristics, clinical manifestations, and clinical risk factors of hvKp infections among patients in a large teaching hospital. A retrospective study was conducted in 123 patients infected with K. pneumoniae at the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University (Luzhou, China) from October 2016 to November 2018. An isolate that positive for both PCR amplification of aerobactin gene and Galleria mellonella infection model was defined as hvKp. Overall, 43.1% (53/123) of K. pneumoniae isolates were hvKp. String tests were performed on all isolates, and MLSTs of all hvKp were conducted. The K1 ST23 isolates were the dominant clone of hvKp (35.8%). Univariate analysis revealed the following risk factors for hvKp: hepatic abscess (OR = 41.818 [95% CI, 5.379–335.086]), bacteremia (OR = 19.94 [95% CI, 5.565–71.446]), metastatic spread (OR = 19.938 [95% CI, 6.344–62.654]), CRP (OR = 1.008 [95% CI, 1.001–1.015]), nitroimidazole treatment (OR = 7.907 [95% CI, 1.652–37.843]), diabetes (OR = 3.067 [95% CI, 1.38–6.817]), and admission to positive culture interval (OR = 3.636 [95% CI, 1.524–8.678]). Moreover, Multivariate analysis implicated hepatic abscess (OR = 74.332 [95% CI, 3.121–1769.588]), bacteremia (OR = 28.388 [95% CI, 3.039–264.200]), and metastatic spread (OR = 19.391 [95% CI, 3.633–103.498]) as independent risk factors for hvKp infections. Thirteen of twenty-one tested antibiotics were founded resistant to non-hvKp, which is significantly greater than hvKp. Importantly, the ESBL-hvKp and MDR-hvKp were responsible for 7.5% and 15.1% in the hvKp group, respectively.</td>

The affinity to hexadecane was significantly increased in ST(WT), ST(KCCM), and ST(CCARM) cells after P22 infection. All strains tested showed relatively higher auto-aggregation abilities in the presence of P22 than the absence of P22. ST(KCCM) showed the greatest auto-aggregative ability (23%) in the presence of P22, while ST(WT) showed the least auto-aggregative ability (9%) in the absence of P22. The bacterial swimming motility affected the bacterial attachment at the early stage of biofilm formation. The red, dry and rough morphotype was observed for all strains tested. The numbers of ST(WT), ST(CIP), and ST(KCCM) planktonic cells were considerably reduced by 7.2, 5.0, and 5.0 log CFU/ml, respectively, and ST(WT), ST(CIP), and ST(KCCM) biofilm-forming cells were reduced by 5.8, 4.5, and 4.9 log, respectively, after 24 h of phage infection. The depolymerase produced by phages were confirmed by the presence of outer rim of plaques. Phages could be considered as promising alternatives for the control of biofilms due to their advantages including enzymatic degradation of extracellular biofilm matrix. The study would provide useful information for understanding the dynamic interactions between phages and biofilms and also designing the effective phage-based control system as an alterative strategy against biofilms.</td>

Our review identified 42 studies examining psychopharmacological (n = 32), psychosocial (n = 7), and neuromodulation (n = 3) treatments. Results suggested that there is early support for the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and cognitive behavioral therapies as augmentative agents to traditional antipsychotic medications to reduce OCS within the context of psychosis.

We aimed to determine the optimal dosage regimen needed to rapidly achieve pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PKPD) targets for virological clearance in pediatrics. A 10,000-subject Monte Carlo simulation was performed to calculate probabilities of efficacy and safety attainment, using allometrically scaled PKPD targets based on published adult pharmacokinetic studies. Allometric scaling of hydroxychloroquine clearance was also performed. The simulation predicted the probability of target attainment (PTA) of each dosage regimen to achieve an 80% PTA and 80% cumulative fraction of response, with &amp;#x003C;10% PTA for toxicity. The loading dosage of 6 mg/kg/dose, four times daily for 2 days, was found to provide rapid virological clearance with a high PTA (92.2%) within 2 days of treatment. Maintenance dosage of 3.25 mg/kg/dose, three times daily for the next 8 days, achieved the appropriate plasma hydroxychloroquine level until treatment cessation, with a PTA &amp;#x003E;80%. As to safety, this dosage regimen achieved a PTA &amp;#x003C;10% of the safety target, giving a probability of cardiotoxicity of &amp;#x003C;0.01%. The optimal hydroxychloroquine regimen is the loading dosage of 6 mg/kg/dose, four times daily for 2 days, followed by maintenance dosage of 3.25 mg/kg/dose, three times daily, on days 3–10. This regimen achieves virological clearance of COVID-19 and low cardiotoxicity in pediatrics. However, clinical studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety.</td>

Clinical pharmacists determined DRPs following (1) medication leaflets, (2) guidelines of the Vietnam Ministry of Health, (3) Vietnamese National Drug Formulary. We checked drug-drug interactions using Drugs.com. Interventions, including a workshop on DRPs, providing information sheets, and reminding physicians about DRPs, were conducted by researchers in collaboration with clinical pharmacists in the study hospital. In the pre-intervention phase, we analyzed 3352 prescriptions. The number of prescriptions with at least 1 DRP was 88.8%. In the post-intervention, we analyzed 2685 prescriptions. The number of prescriptions with at least 1 DRP decreased from 88.8% to 74.9% (p&lt;0.001). Pharmacist interventions are effective on DRPs in drug indications (p&lt;0.001), dosage (p&lt;0.001), frequency of use (p&lt;0.001), time of taking medications (p&lt;0.001). There was no significant improvement in DRPs of the time of taking drugs compared with meals and drug-drug interaction after interventions. The number of DRP increases with the number of drugs prescribed (p&lt;0.001). In conclusion, pharmacist-led interventions reduced the propor-tion of prescriptions with DRPs.

      <td>Introduction: Microbiological maps are considered an epidemiological marker as statistically summarize circulating bacteria and their behavior against antibiotics in use. They allow establishing an antibiotic policy that guarantees the most rational use of antimicrobials and decreases the risk of bacterial resistance. Objectives: Identify the isolated bacteria with more frequency from microbiological crops of hospitalized patients in the Institute of Hematology and Immunology during the year 2020 and determine the resistance of the most frequent bacteria to the antimicrobials tested, with a view to establishing the first microbiological map of the institution. Methods: An observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed that included cultures of patients hospitalized during the year 2020. Bacterial identification was carried out according to conventional methods and to determine the resistance profiles was used by the Bauer-Kirby method. Results: The blood culture was the most indicated microbiological study with 32.80% positivity. The Gram negative bacteria predominated (81.71%), being the most identified Pseudomona spp., Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli. Among the Gram positive bacteria predominate Staphylococcus spp. coagulase negative. High percentages of resistance were obtained in front of almost all antimicrobials evaluated. Conclusions: The completion of the institutional microbiological map allows updating the antimicrobial use policy by identifying the Gram negative bacilli, with high percentages of resistance, as the main etiological agents of the infections registered in this health center during 2020.</td>

With the COVID-19 pandemic, treatment of typhoid became a challenge as focus was driven towards limiting the COVID-19 spread, and hence preferential use of antibiotics such as azithromycin may limit future empirical antibiotic therapy for typhoid. Socioeconomic disparities and geographical as well as demographic barriers further limit access to appropriate typhoid management. Lastly, illiteracy and self-medication with antibiotics may predispose Pakistan to another outbreak of typhoid. These concerns, although largely unaddressed effectively, need immediate action. Previously, the government and international organizations have made efforts to control the spread through the introduction of TCV as a part of EPI and awareness, additional improvements are needed.

      <td>Bacteria have evolved many different signal transduction systems that sense signals and generate a variety of responses. Generally, most abundant are transcriptional regulators, sensor histidine kinases and chemoreceptors. Typically, these systems recognize their signal molecules with dedicated ligand-binding domains (LBDs), which, in turn, generate a molecular stimulus that modulates the activity of the output module. There are an enormous number of different LBDs that recognize a similarly diverse set of signals. To give a global perspective of the signals that interact with transcriptional regulators, sensor kinases and chemoreceptors, we manually retrieved information on the protein-ligand interaction from about 1,200 publications and 3D structures. The resulting 811 proteins were classified according to the Pfam family into 127 groups. These data permit a delineation of the signal profiles of individual LBD families as well as distinguishing between families that recognize signals in a promiscuous manner and those that possess a well-defined ligand range. A major bottleneck in the field is the fact that the signal input of many signaling systems is unknown. The signal repertoire reported here will help the scientific community design experimental strategies to identify the signaling molecules for uncharacterised sensor proteins.</td>

Here, clinical avian pathogenic E. coli isolates (CEC; n = 50) and faecal E. coli isolates from healthy (FEC; n = 187) Australian meat chickens collected between 2006 and 2014 were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, phylogenetic grouping, plasmid replicon (PR) typing, multilocus sequence typing, and virulence gene (VG) profiling. Extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)- and fluoroquinolone (FQ)-resistant E. coli isolates underwent further genetic characterization. Significant proportions of CEC and FEC were, respectively, susceptible (13/50; 48/187) or MDR (9/50; 26/187) to 20 tested antimicrobials. Phylogenetic groups A and C, and PR types IncFIB and IncFrep were most represented. Five tested CEC-associated VGs were more prevalent in CEC (≥ 90%) than FEC (≤ 58%). Some isolates (CEC n = 3; FEC n = 7) were resistant to ESCs and/or FQs and possessed signature mutations in chromosomal FQ target genes and plasmid-mediated qnrS, bla (CMY-2), and bla (DHA-1) genes. Sequence type 354 (n = 4), associated with extraintestinal infections in a broad range of hosts, was prevalent among ESC- and/or FQ-resistant FEC. This study confirmed existence of a small reservoir of ESC- and FQ-resistant E. coli in Australian commercial meat chickens despite absence of use in the industry of these drugs. Otherwise, diversity of VGs and PR types in both FEC and CEC populations was identified. We hypothesize that the source of ESC- and FQ-resistant E. coli is external to poultry production facilities.

Less frequently nocardiosis can interest immunocompetent population, causing especially primary cutaneous infections. Cutaneous involvement by Nocardia spp. may occur mostly as one of four clinical manifestations: superficial cellulitis or abscess, mycetoma, lymphocutaneous (also defined “sporotrichoid”) infection and secondary cutaneous involvement from systemic disease. Infections usually present after minor local injury, especially in traumatic outdoor activities (e.g. gardeners, farmers, road accidents), with subsequent environmental contamination of the wound. In sporadic cases cutaneous infection follows an insect bite. Microbiological diagnosis is often difficult to obtain and N. brasiliensis is the species isolated in most cases (80%). We present the case of a 45-year-old female with fever and a painful and necrotizing lesion on her right leg with secondary ascending lesions occurred on the homolateral knee and consensual groin lymphadenopathy after insect sting (maybe a spider bite). Cultures on skin biopsy identified Nocardia brasiliensis. Infection was completely healed after 5 months of targeted antibiotic therapy. In addition, we performed a literature review of all cutaneous nocardiosis cases in immunocompetent individuals, finding that only in 22 cases the infection presented after insect bite; in most of these cases lymphocutaneous manifestation was seen and N. brasiliensis was the Nocardia species isolated. Our case, along with others in literature, reveals that the real burden of soft-tissues nocardiosis seems low but probably many cases might go undiagnosed because of difficulties in microbiology diagnosis. Primary cutaneous nocardiosis should be included in the diagnostic pathway in cases of cellulitis following insect bite or sting, especially when localized to extremities.</td>

      <td>~ Objectives: Young patients with intellectual disability (ID) have both diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. These include, inter alia, diagnostic overshadowing, diagnostic slippage and heightened vulnerability to adverse drug reactions. These would portent a generally poor prognostication. Methods: This is a case-study of an adolescent with intellectual disability long-hospitalized for co-morbid treatment-resistant bipolar mood disorder that failed to respond to ECT. Patient partially responded to LAI risperidone with repeated ADRs. Top-up with low-dose clozapine (100 mg/d) was pursued. Results: Low-dose clozapine top-up complemented therapeutic response (mood lability and paranoia) and strikingly safeguarded effectively against risperidone-related extrapyramidal side effects. Conclusions: Add-on clozapine remains a viable option, albeit off-label, in young patients with ID and treatment-resistant affective/schizophreniform psychoses.

      <td>Giraffes have long been a subject of study for scientists due to the physiological anomaly their anatomical design can present. The study of the species helps aid in understanding of clinically relevant processes. The long trachea of a giraffe presents the dilemma of exaggerated dead space; however, this physiological problem is surmounted by a narrow trachea when compared to mammals of similar size, thus decreasing potential dead space. As COVID-19 patients in the hospital and ICU can develop COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome, limiting excess dead space in COVID-19 patients is favorable. Removing additional tubing for a patient with an endotracheal tube in a ventilator circuit could help lower the patient’s PaCO(2) and raise their pH.</td>

      <td>Objective: This study aims to compare the clinical features of varicella and herpes zoster infections in cancer patients with chronic immunocompromised patients. Material and Methods: Medical records of 144 immunocompromised patients between the ages of 0 and 18 were examined. The patients were divided into two groups. Group A consisted of cancer patients, while Group B consisted of patients with non-cancer immunodeficiency. Data were collected showing the complications associated with varicella-zoster virus, length of hospital stay, vaccination status, acyclovir, intravenous immunoglobulin, antibiotic therapy, and disease outcomes. Results: Of 144 children patients, 55 (38.2%) were in Group A and 89 (61.8%) were in Group B. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (54.5%) in Group A and neurological disorders (33.8%) in Group B were the underlying primary disease. Seventeen of those with herpes zoster disease were in Group A, and 83 of those with varicella disease were in Group B. Chickenpox/herpes zoster was observed more in the spring (70.4%) in Group B and in the summer season in Group A (53.1%). The median duration of the rash was nine (3-36) days in chickenpox and 10 (8-12) days in herpes zoster. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of CRP positivity and antibiotic treatment (p&gt; 0.05). 38.1% of the patients in Group A and 5.6% of the patients in Group B were neutropenic (p&lt; 0.05). There were complications in 54 patients in Group A and 25 patients in group B. Among the complications, secondary bacterial infection/sepsis was seen more in Group A than in Group B. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in the distribution of acyclovir use and the duration of acyclovir (p&lt; 0.05). The length of hospital stay between groups was longer in group A (p&lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Varicella zoster infections are one of the important causes of mortality and morbidity in pediatric oncology patients. The frequency of herpes zoster is higher in cancer patients compared to other immunodeficient patients and close monitoring is required. At least one complication can often be seen in immunocompromised patients who become ill with varicella zoster virus, and it is possible to prevent complications or to decrease their severity by starting acyclovir/antiviral therapy without delay. Cancer patients require a longer period of acyclovir treatment than other immunocompromised VZV patients. Initiation of acyclovir/ antiviral therapy by hospitalization of cancer patients with varicella zoster virus infection and other immunodeficient patients without delay will decrease the complications and mortality rates of varicella zoster virus. Multidisciplinary follow-up of pediatric infection specialists, pediatric hematology-oncology specialists and other specialists who follow immunocompromised patients will reduce the morbidity and mortality of VZV infections in these patient groups.</td>

      <td>Background: Superficial Pyogenic Infection (SPI) is the type of a pyogenic infection, which involves the infections of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and soft tissue. These infections can cause significant morbidity. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) has emerged due to the rampant use of broad-spectrum agents in superficial pyogenic infections. Objective: The aim of the study was to identify the microbial profile of superficial pyogenic infections and study their antimicrobial resistance. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was carried out at the Department of Microbiology of a tertiary care hospital in the western region of Rajasthan. Samples included pus, aspirate from the abscess, necrotic tissue, and post-surgical drainage from infected skin at different sites of the patients attending OPD or admitted in IPD and ICU of the hospital. Identification of isolates was carried out by standard bacteriological techniques. The Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (AST) of bacterial isolates was done by Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar (HiMedia, India), and in a few cases, by automated Microscan system as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), Wayne, USA. Results: A total of 2283 various specimens were obtained from different areas of healthcare facilities. Pathogenic bacterial isolates were recovered from 303 specimens. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were found to be the main offenders. The effective antibiotics for gram-positive isolates were clindamycin, cotrimoxazole, linezolid, tetracycline, and vancomycin, and for gram-negative bacteria, meropenem, imipenem and amikacin were seen to be effective. Conclusion: This study can help formulate a local antibiotic policy which will restrict the unsuper-vised antibiotic use and strengthen antibiotic stewardship practices in the hospitals.</td>

The current investigation aimed to study the combined antimicrobial effect of crude Neem extract and selected antibiotics namely Ciprofloxacin, Cefixime, Chloramphenicol, Ampicillin, Sulfamethoxazole, Tetracycline and Ofloxacin on selected Gram’s positive and negative micro organism. Crude alcoholic Neem leaf extract was used for the study. Method: Solution A containing Neem extract 5 mg mL(-1) alone, Solution B comprising of Standard antibiotics alone 5 mg mL(-1) and Solution C containing combination of 2.5 mg mL(-1) of Neem extract and selected standard antibiotic at a concentration of 2.5 mg mL(-1) were tested for their antibacterial potential against selected strain of micro-organisms namely Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcous aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli and Bacillus subtilis using agar plate technique. Results: The obtained results indicated the synergistic activity of the Neem extract and the selected antibiotics. It was observed that half concentration of antibiotic was sufficient to exert the antimicrobial effect when they were combined with Neem extract. Thus, the dose of standard antibiotics may be marginally reduced to almost half in concentration when combined with the Neem extract without compromising the efficacy. The zones of inhibition indicated that the combination of Neem extract and antibiotic exerted a synergistic effect which will facilitate to achieve reduction of the dose of standard antibiotics. Conclusions: It can be concluded from the research that Neem extract when combined with the conventional antibiotic(s) can be used as a novel antimicrobial agent which exhibits a synergistic effect and also helpful to achieve a dose reduction of conventional antibiotic(s).</td>

      <td>Exploring the therapeutic potential of acetonic plant extracts in the healing of skin wounds infected with multidrug resistant pathogens</td>
      <td>Open wounds are easily susceptible to infection by multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. The emergence of MDR super bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp, fungi such as Aspergillus niger and Candida spp, has been identified to significantly increase the incidence rate. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a suitable barrier to prevent infection and enhance wound healing. On the other hand, medicinal plants could represent a significant source of new antimicrobial drugs for combating MDR pathogens. Out of 60 clinical skin burn cases, 51 patients (85%) had polymicrobial infections, while the remaining had monomicrobial infections. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumonia were identified as the most common bacterial isolates based on morphological and biochemical tests. However, Candida albicans, Candida parasitosis, Candida glabrata, Candida famata, Aspergillus niger, and Exophilia spinifera were the most common fungal isolates found in skin burn cases. MDR classification was reported in 21 of the 39 bacterial isolates and 8 of the 27 fungal isolates. The antimicrobial activity of tested acetonic plant extracts rosemary, henna, and licorice against MDR isolates was compared to the commercial antibiotic agents. Acetonic rosemary extract outperformed henna and licorice extracts in antibacterial activity, while licorice extract outperformed henna and rosemary extracts on antifungal activity. As a result, rosemary and licorice extracts were chosen to prepare a topical cream for further in vivo wound healing and histopathology. Based on the antimicrobial potential of acetonic plant extracts against MDR isolates, BI-41 and FI-17 were chosen for in vivo wound healing. BI-41 stands for the molecularly identified species Pseudomonas aeruginosa SSM-15, while FI-17 stands for molecularly identified species Aspergillus niger SSM-27. In vivo testing showed that both cream formulas had excellent healing properties when administered topically. In vivo histopathological examination revealed that acetonic rosemary and licorice extract could be promising for wound healing, combating MDR pathogens of burn wound infections.</td>

      <td>Objective: Rare disease Background: Neurosyphilis is a central nervous system infection caused by Treponema pallidum, that can develop at any time after the initial infection. The clinical signs of neurosyphilis are very variable, as well as its radiological features, and it is a diagnostic challenge. Knowledge of clinical symptoms and correct laboratory diagnostics, combined with routine radiological examination and additional diagnostic tools, such as high-resolution, threedimensional FLAIR sequence, T2-weighted, and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are key to making an accurate diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Case Report: We present the clinical case of a patient who presented a 1-year history of vague clinical symptoms and was misdiagnosed with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. Initial head MRI revealed extensive cerebral white matter lesions with cortical contrast enhancement, mainly of anterior and medial parts of the left temporal lobe, as typically seen in HSV encephalitis. Empirical therapy with acyclovir was started until a diagnosis of syphilis was confirmed with laboratory findings. Later, the therapy was changed to penicillin G. The patient’s condition improved after receiving targeted treatment. A control MRI scan was performed, and previously detected changes in the brain had decreased significantly. Conclusions: MRI is the imaging of choice to support the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Our findings suggest that neuroimaging can play an important role in indicating suspicion of syphilitic encephalitis. Enhancement of the anterior and medial parts of the temporal lobe is an atypical imaging finding, and it can simulate an infection with HSV. Early treatment is critical to a positive outcome.</td>

Method This is an interventional study conducted at Upendra Devkota Memorial National Institute of Neurological and Allied sciences, Bansbari over 1 year (2017 March-2018 February). One hundred eighteen patients with new onset seizure secondary to active solitary cysticercal granuloma either received albendazole therapy for 1, 3, 9 or 21 days with the usual care or only received the usual care. Clinical and radiological outcomes were observed at one month follow-up. The difference in the proportion of the outcome measures between intervention and control groups were assessed using chi-square test. Result Our study included 118 patients with male predominance of 61.9%. Albendazole therapy for 3, 9 and 21 days reduced headache by 57.2%, 70.0% and 63.1% respectively which was higher than those with 1-day therapy or without the therapy. This difference in the proportion was statistically significant at p=0.001. Though seizure recurrence also declined but the difference was not significant (p=0.406) between groups. However, at one-month follow-up, majority of patients who received albendazole for 9 days (14, 70%) and 21 days (14, 73.7%) had normal lesion, while most calcified lesion (21, 67.7%) was observed in those who did not receive albendazole therapy. The difference between lesion among the groups was significant (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Albendazole therapy in patients with active solitary neurocysticercosis for 9 days is as effective as 21 days and better than 3 days in headache control and lesion dissolution but seizure control could be achieved irrespective of the treatment.</td>

These E. coli isolates originated from two pigs (TH2 and TH3) and two humans (TH8 and TH9) from Thailand, and three pigs from Lao PDR (LA1, LA2 and LA3). Four E. coli sequence types/serotypes – ST6833/H20 (TH2 and TH3), ST48/O160:H40 (TH8 and TH9), ST5708/H45 (LA1) and ST10562/O148:H30 (LA2 and LA3) – were identified. The plasmid replicon type IncF was identified in all isolates. The point mutations Ser31Thr in PmrA and His2Arg in PmrB were found concurrently in all isolates (colistin MIC=4–8 µg ml(−1)). LA1 contained up to five point mutations in PmrB, and the colistin MIC was not significantly different from that for the other isolates. All mcr-1.1 was located in the ISApl1-mcr-1-pap2 element, while all mcr-3.1 was located in the TnAs2-mcr-3.1-dgkA-ISKpn40 element. The mcr-3.1 and bla(CTX-M-55) genes were co-localized on the same plasmid, which concurrently contained cml, qnrS1 and tmrB. The bla(CTX-M-55) and mcr-3.1 genes were located on conjugative plasmids and could be transferred horizontally under selective pressure from ampicillin or colistin. In conclusion, comprehensive insights into the genomic information of ESBL-producing E. coli harbouring mcr were obtained. As mcr-carrying ESBL-producing E. coli were detected in pigs and humans, a holistic and multisectoral One Health approach is required to contain antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</td>

The EUCAST and CLSI criteria were used for MIC value assessment. The genes, associated with pathogenicity factors, and resistance to antifungal drugs were identified. Results. Our study results based on EUCAST 2020, v.10.0 criteria showed that triazoles, especially fluconazole, were the least effective drugs in empirical therapy for invasive candidiasis (including candidemia). Resistance of Candida spp. fluconazole was superior to that of voriconazole (47.2 % vs 23.2 %, respectively, p&lt;0.01) and posaconazole (47.2 % vs 30.4 %, respectively, p&lt;0.05). The highest in vitro activity was observed in echinocandins, and anidulafungin was 2 times more active than micafungin (4.1 % of resistant strains vs 11.4 %, respectively), with no statistically significant difference (p&gt;0.05). The ERG11 and FKS1 genes associated with resistance to antifungal drugs were detected in 28.6 % of Candida spp. strains. The ERG11 gene was detected in 8.6 % of cases, exclusively in Candida albicans strains. The FKS1 gene was identified in 20.0 % of strains (85.7 % of them were C. parapsilosis, 7.1 % each were C. tropicalis and C. glabrata). Pathogenic factor genes were identified in 78.6 % of C. albicans and in 79.1 % of C. parapsilosis strains. Conclusion. Molecular genetic methods for the detection of Candida spp strains carrying resistance genes to antifungal drugs, and the determination of pathogenicity factors are promising trends in searching for biomarkers. They facilitate interpretation of results of microbiological study to assess the ability of Candida spp. strains to develop invasive mycoses.</td>

      <td>Economic Evaluation of Multiple-Pharmacogenes Testing for the Prevention of Adverse Drug Reactions in People Living with HIV</td>
      <td>Purpose: Pharmacogenetics (PGx) testing is one of the methods for determining whether individuals are at risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). It has been reported that multiple-PGx testing, a sequencing technology, has a higher predictive value than single-PGx testing. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the most cost-effective PGx testing strategies for preventing drug-induced serious ADRs in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Patients and Methods: Potential strategies, including 1) single-PGx esting (ie, HLA-B*57:01 testing before prescribing abacavir, HLA-B*13:01 testing before prescribing co-trimoxazole and dapsone, and NAT2 testing before prescribing isoniazid) and 2) multiple-PGx testing as a combination of four single-gene PGx tests in one panel, were all compared to no PGx testing (current practice). To evaluate total cost in Thai baht (THB) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each strategy-based approach to a societal perspective, a hybrid decision tree and Markov model was constructed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated. Uncertainty, threshold, and scenario analyses were all performed. Results: Before prescribing HIV therapy, providing single or multiple-PGx testing might save roughly 68 serious ADRs per year, and the number needed to screen (NNS) to avoid one serious ADR was 40. Consequently, approximately 35% and 40% of the cost of ADR treatment could be avoided by the implementation of single- and multiple-PGx testing, respectively. Compared with no PGx testing strategy, the ICERs were 146,319 THB/QALY gained for single-PGx testing and 152,014 THB/QALY gained for multiple-PGx testing. Moreover, the probability of multiple-PGx testing being cost-effective was 45% at the Thai willingness to pay threshold of 160,000 THB per QALY. Threshold analyses showed that multiple-PGx testing remained cost-effective under the range of cost, sensitivity at 0.95–1.00 and specificity at 0.98–1.00. Conclusion: Single and multiple-PGx testing might be cost-effective options for reducing the incidence of drug-induced serious ADRs in people living with HIV.</td>

      <td>A Gram-negative, obligate aerobic, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterium lacking a flagellum, was isolated from sediment sampled at the Dapeng peninsula of Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, and designated strain DP4N28-5(T). Growth of strain DP4N28-5(T) occurred at 15–45 °C (optimum at 30 °C), pH 6.0–8.0 (optimum at 6.0) and in 2.0–10.0% NaCl (w/v; optimum at 2.0–3.0%). The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain DP4N28-5(T) was most closely related to Maritimibacter alkaliphilus DSM 100037(T) (97.6%; sequence similarity). The strain synthesized a trace amount of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate. The dominant cellular fatty acids were summed feature 8 (C(18:1) ω6c and/or C(18:1) ω7c), C(16:0), 11-mehtyl C(18:1) ω7c and C(16:0) 2-OH. The major polar lipids included phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, one unidentified aminophospholipid, three unidentified aminolipids and four unidentified lipids. The respiratory quinone was Q-10. The DNA G+C content was 62.0mol% and the estimated genome size was 3.9 Mbp. The calculated average nucleotide value between strain DP4N28-5(T) and M. alkaliphilus DSM 100037(T) was 78.1%. The phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic differences between strain DP4N285(T) and its phylogenetic relatives indicate that DP4N28-5(T) represents a novel species in the genus Maritimibacter, for which the name Maritimibacter dapengensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is DP4N28-5(T) (=MCCC 1K05640(T)=KCTC 82805(T)). The description of genus Maritimibacter was emended to include this new species.</td>

      <td>Antibiotic resistant bacteria: current situation and treatment options to accelerate the development of a new antimicrobial arsenal</td>
      <td>Introduction: Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest public health threats worldwide. Currently, antibiotic-resistant bacteria kill 700,000 people every year. These data represent the near future in which we find ourselves, a ‘post-antibiotic era’ where the identification and development of new treatments are key. This review is focused on the current and emerging antimicrobial therapies which can solve this global threat. Areas covered: Through a literature search using databases such as Medline and Web of Science, and search engines such as Google Scholar, different antimicrobial therapies were analyzed, including pathogen-oriented therapy, phagotherapy, microbiota and antivirulent therapy. Additionally, the development pathways of new antibiotics were described, emphasizing on the potential advantages that the combination of a drug repurposing strategy with the application of mathematical prediction models could bring to solve the problem of AMRs. Expert opinion: This review offers several starting points to solve a single problem: reducing the number of AMR. The data suggest that the strategies described could provide many benefits to improve antimicrobial treatments. However, the development of new antimicrobials remains necessary. Drug repurposing, with the application of mathematical prediction models, is considered to be of interest due to its rapid and effective potential to increase the current therapeutic arsenal.</td>

      <td>Background – Acute cholangitis (AC) is a gastro-intestinal emergency associated with significant mortality. Role of change in the levels of inflammatory markers post drainage in predicting outcome in acute cholangitis is uncertain. Objective – To evaluate the predictive value of changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin levels after biliary drainage in relation to outcomes (survival or mortality) at 1 month. Methods – A prospective observational study of consecutive adults presenting with AC was performed. At admission and at 48 hours post biliary drainage, pro-calcitonin and CRP were sent. Results – Between August 2020 till December 2020 we recruited 72 consecutive patients of AC. The median age of the patients was 55 years (range 43–62 years) and 42 (58.33%) were females. Although the delta change in serum procalcitonin (P value&lt;0.001) and CRP (P value&lt;0.001) was significant, it had no bearing on the outcome. Altered sensorium and INR were independently associated with mortality at 1 month. The 30-day mortality prediction of day 0 procalcitonin was measured by receiver operating characteristic analysis which resulted in an area under the curve of 0.697 with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of 0.545–0.849. The optimal cut-off of procalcitonin would be 0.57ng/mL with a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 60% respectively to predict mortality. Conclusion – Change in serum procalcitonin and CRP levels at 48 hours post drainage although significant, had no impact on the outcome of acute cholangitis.</td>

      <td>Antiviral Susceptibilities of Avian Influenza A(H5), A(H7), and A(H9) Viruses Isolated in Japan</td>
      <td>The circulation of avian influenza A viruses in poultry is a public health concern due to the potential transmissibility and severity of these viral infections. Monitoring the susceptibility of these viruses to antivirals is important for developing measures to strengthen the level of preparedness against influenza pandemics. However, drug susceptibility information on these viruses is limited. Here, we determined the susceptibilities of avian influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N8), A(H7N7), A(H7N9), A(H9N1), and A(H9N2) viruses isolated in Japan to the antivirals approved for use there: an M2 inhibitor (amantadine), neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir) and RNA polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir and favipiravir). Genotypic methods that detect amino acid substitutions associated with antiviral resistance and phenotypic methods that assess phenotypic viral susceptibility to drugs have revealed that these avian influenza A viruses are susceptible to neuraminidase and RNA polymerase inhibitors. These results suggest that neuraminidase and RNA polymerase inhibitors currently approved in Japan could be a treatment option against influenza A virus infections in humans.</td>

      <td>Risk Factors for Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Bacteremia</td>
      <td>Objective: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) is an opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen with high mortality. And it has intrinsic resistance to a number of antibiotics classes. In this study, we investigated risk factors for death due to S. maltophilia bacteremia. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary-care hospital in Beijing, China. The patients from the hospital database with S. maltophilia bacteremia between January 2011 and December 2020 were investigated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with mortality. Results: 51 patients with S. maltophilia bacteremia were identified. The mortality rate was 37.3%. Based on the univariate analysis, pulmonary disease (P=0.019), chronic kidney disease (P=0.014), shock (P=0.002), foley catheter (P=0.011), the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score (P&lt;0.001), procalcitonin (PCT) (P=0.045) and using antifungal agent (P=0.033) were significantly related to mortality. Based on the multivariate analysis, the APACHE II score (odds ratio [OR] =1.211; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.061, 1.382; P=0.005) was independent factor associated with mortality. S. maltophilia was the most susceptible to minocycline (94.7%), followed by trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX, 92.2%). Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the APACHE II score was a significantly independent predictor in S. maltophilia bacteremia patients. The use of TMP/SMX or minocycline might be the first choice for the treatment of S. maltophilia bacteremia.</td>

      <td>Neglected Tropical Diseases amenable to Preventive Chemotherapy (PC-NTDs) affect the poorest populations around the world, especially in Africa. Scientific information on the distribution and level of endemicity of these diseases in the Republic of the Congo (RoC) is scarce in the published literature. We sought to collect all available epidemiological data on PC-NTDs in the RoC to document the historical and current situation and identify challenges in reaching the elimination of NTDs. Methods We searched Medline and Horizon databases for studies published until to July 4(th), 2019, on onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, soil-transmitted helminth infections, schistosomiasis, and trachoma in the RoC. Unpublished reports were also reviewed. We included all epidemiological studies containing community data and excluded case reports. Location, prevalence data, and dates of the studies were extracted. Principal findings We identified 933 records, of which 56 met the inclusion criteria. The articles published before 1960 mainly concerned onchocerciasis and schistosomiasis. Despite a low number over the studied period, since 2005 there has been a steady increase in the number of publications. Most of the studies were cross-sectional and conducted in the general population. Trachoma is endemic in the Sangha and Likouala departments (prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular &gt; 5% in some villages), and further mapping is essential to properly assess the burden of this disease in the country. While the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths is still high (over 20%) in a large part of Congo, cases of lymphatic filariasis (based on Wuchereria bancrofti antigenaemia and/or microfilaraemia) and onchocerciasis are becoming rare and very focused. To achieve the elimination of PC-NTDs, further intervention is required. Conclusions Except for trachoma, whose epidemiological situation should be better evaluated, PC-NTDs are endemic in the RoC, and actions to control them have been taken by health authorities. To eliminate PC-NTDs, which are still present in some locations, new mapping surveys are needed, and increased investment in scientific research should be encouraged in the country.</td>

      <td>Introduction: Disease due to pulmonary infection with Aspergillus, and other emerging opportunistic fungi remains a significant unmet need. Existing antifungal medicines are predominantly dosed either orally or systemically, but because of limited exposure to the lung lumen, adverse events, and problematic drug-drug interactions, inhaled treatment could provide an attractive option. Area covered: This review summarizes 1) the limitations of current antifungal therapy, 2) the beneficial effects of inhaled antifungal agents, 3) the clinical development of inhaled antifungal triazoles (repurposed with an innovative inhalation system or a novel inhaled agent) for the treatment of pulmonary fungal infections, and 4) the difficulties and challenges of inhaled antifungal agent development. Regrettably, details of novel inhaled devices or formulations were not covered. Expert opinion: Inhaled antifungal treatment could provide an attractive option by shifting the risk benefit ratio of treatment favorably. Preclinical and clinical studies with inhaled antifungal agents (off-label use) are encouraging so far. New inhaled antifungal triazoles are well tolerated in early clinical studies and warrant further clinical development. However, challenges remain and many unaddressed issues including required preclinical studies, appropriate clinical design, pharmacokinetics, delivery system(s) and regulatory process need to be resolved. Early communication with regulatory authorities is therefore recommended.</td>

      <td>Drug Repurposing for Cancer Therapy in the Era of Precision Medicine</td>
      <td>Drug repurposing refers to the identification of clinically approved drugs with the known safety profiles and defined pharmacokinetic properties for new indications. Despite the advances in oncology research, cancers are still associated with the most unmet medical needs. Drug repurposing has emerged as a useful approach for the search for effective and durable cancer treatment. It may also represent a promising strategy to facilitate precision cancer treatment and overcome drug resistance. The repurposing of non-cancer drugs for precision oncology effectively extends the inventory of actionable molecular targets and thus increases the number of patients who may benefit from precision cancer treatment. In cancer types where genetic heterogeneity is so high that it is not feasible to identify strong repurposed drug candidates for standard treatment, the precision oncology approach offers individual patients access to novel treatment options. For repurposed candidates with low potency, a combination of multiple repur-posed drugs may produce a synergistic therapeutic effect. Precautions should be taken when combining repurposed drugs with anticancer agents to avoid detrimental drug-drug interactions and unwanted side effects. New multifactorial data analysis and artificial intelligence methods are needed to untangle the complex association of molecular signatures influencing specific cancer subtypes to facilitate drug repur-posing in precision oncology.</td>

      <td>Background: Coinfection with Pneumocystis jirovecii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis is rare in HIV-seronegative patients. Because it is associated with unknown morbidity and a high mortality rate especially in patients with immunosuppression, health care practitioners should have a high index of suspicion when dealing with such patients. Case Presentation: A 66-year-old man with glucocorticoid therapy for 9 years had a fever after getting a cold and developed respiratory failure rapidly within 3 days. He was given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole empirically before Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was confirmed with the presence of cysts in the sputum. Although there was a partial improvement of symptoms, an area of consolidation on the left upper lung lobe gradually enlarged. Bronchoscopy was performed 3 times and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was finally diagnosed. For 1 years, he was treated with standard antituberculosis agents, and his psychological well-being was managed using traditional Chinese medicine techniques. After 3 years of follow-up, his outcome was very good. Conclusion: HIV-seronegative patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy in areas with a high incidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis may be co-infected with Pneumocystis jirovecii. When opportunistic infections are suspected, diagnostic procedures including invasive ones should be performed as soon as possible and appropriate interventions need to be carried out promptly.</td>

      <td>Aim: The objective of this study was to study the antimicrobial drugs utilization pattern in medical ICU in Darbhanga Medical College &amp; Hospital, Laheriasarai, Darbhanga, Bihar, India. Methodology: It was a retrospective and observational study, conducted during the period of 1 year (May, 2021 to April, 2022). Data of 120 patients was collected from the Central Record Section (CRS) of the hospital. The data was analyzed for demographic distribution, disease pattern and antimicrobial drugs use. The data was entered in MS Excel sheet and results were presented as tables and figures. Drug utilization data was presented as percentage. Results: Total 120 patients were enrolled in the study. Out of 120 patients, males were 76 (63.3%) and females were 44 (36.7%). The mean age of males was 59.54 ± 21.73 years and females were 63.82 ± 19.24 years. 50 (41.7%) patients were more than 60 years of age. Most of the patients were &gt;40 years of age. CVS system was affected in 94 (78.3%), followed by respiratory system in 8 (6.7%), excretory system in 5 (4.2%), GIT in 4 (3.3%), CNS in 3 (2.5%) and others in 6 (5%) patients. Duration of Hospital Stay was 1-3 days in 93 patients, 4-7 days in 22 patients and more than 7 days in 5 patients. At the end 69 (57.5%) patients were referred, 41 (34.2%) patients were discharged, and 10 (8.3%) patients left against medical advice (LAMA). A total of 84 antibiotics in 120 patients were used. Most commonly 3(rd) generation cephalosporin was prescribed in 44 patients, macrolides in 25 patients, quinolones in 7 patients, anti-anaerobics in 5 patients, tetracycline in 3 patients, oxazolidinones in 3 patients, aminoglycosides and antifungals in 2 patients each and others in 1 patient. Conclusion: Antimicrobial prescription pattern was found to be appropriate in terms of hospital and supplemental indicators. But there is a need for improvement in the area of prescribing and patient care indicators and the use of guidelines, educational initiatives, surveillance, and antibiotic restriction policies at all levels of health care. Results of this study may help the primary healthcare providers to rationalize the antibiotic utilization for better patient care.</td>

Moreover, the systematic antibodies treated was used for 14 and used for the 22 case and 109 control patients. The Univariate regression analysis has suggested an improvement in risk of recurrent infection with longer antibiotic treatment (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.28, p = 0.049). The patient’s sub-sample with extramedullary fracture device-associated infections. Moreover, the baseline criteria were found well in both case and control and none of them is related to recurrent infection in univariate analysis. Conclusion: From the analysis, it has been considered that exposure of the infection in surgical process is having a significant impact on the health of the patients and affecting the recovery. Moreover, the large-scale confirmatory trails are needed for confirm the issues and developing the systematic process of reducing the reinfection among the surgical patients.</td>

      <td>Acquired Hemophilia Associated with Rheumatic Diseases: A Case-Based Systematic Review</td>
      <td>To strengthen the understanding of rheumatic diseases (RDs) as the most common underlying conditions associated with acquired hemophilia (AH), a potentially fatal bleeding condition due to the development of autoantibodies or inhibitors to coagulation factor VIII, and rarely to factor IX, here we presented two cases of RDs associated AH to elucidate the disease progression, treatment, and prognosis. The presented 2 cases showed good responses to glucocorticoid (GC) and immunosuppressive agents. And then, a case-based systematic review was conducted to better understand the clinically practiced diagnosis and treatment of RDs associated AH. A total of 14 articles were included in the final literature review. All the identified 14 patients with underlying RDs and AH presented with bleeding symptoms, increased APTT, decreased FVIII activity, and positive FVIII inhibitors. Twelve of the 14 patients (85.7%) started an eradication of autoantibodies treatment with GC and immunosuppressive agents. Among which six patients achieved partial or complete remission, and four patients (28.6%) switched to Rituximab and responded well. Nine of the 14 patients received hemostasis therapy, including recombinant human FVIIa (rFVIIa). Two patients (14.3%) died due to mass bleeding and key organ failure. AH should be highly suspected in patients with RDs presenting spontaneous mucocutaneous or internal bleeding and an isolated prolonged APTT. Given the high morbidity of AH, it is important to facilitate efficient and proper management.</td>

      <td>Background: Patients who are lost to follow-up while on treatment compromise their own health and the long-term success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs. Besides, loss to follow-up (LTFU) increases HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the incidence of LTFU and its predictors among adult HIV positive patients on anti-retroviral therapy at North Shoa zone public hospitals, Northeast Ethiopia. Methods: A retrospective follow up study of 517 people living with HIV/AIDS and attending an ART clinic between 2015 and 2020 was conducted at North Shewa zone, public hospitals. Kaplan-Meier failure function together with log rank test was used to compare failure function. Multivariable Cox proportion hazards regression model was used to determine predictors of LTFU. Result: The incidence density rate of lost to follow up among HIV positive adult on ART was found to be 8.9 per 100 adult years observation (95%CI; 7.45, 10.68). In multivariable cox proportional regression analysis, WHO clinical stage-IV (AHR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.75), comorbidity disease (AHR = 0.54; 95% CI; 0.30, 0.97), body mass index less than 18kg/m2 (AHR = 1.60; 95% CI; 1.02, 2.51), cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (AHR = 1.57; 95% CI;1.09, 2.53), and a low CD4 count (AHR = 1.66; 95% CI; 1.29, 3.49) were found to be a significant predictors of lost to follow up. Conclusion: The current study showed that the incidence rate of loss to ART follow-up was high. Body mass index score less than 18kg/m2, advanced WHO clinical stage, CD4&lt;200cell/mm(3), had comorbidity disease, and cotrimoxazole therapy were a significant predictors of lost to ART follow up. Therefore, appropriate mitigation measures in the at-risk group need to be instigated to advance retention rate.</td>

      <td>Hair Zidovudine Concentrations Predict Virologic Outcomes Among People Living with HIV/AIDS in China</td>
      <td>Background: Hair antiretroviral concentrations are an objective and non-invasive measure of adherence to long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) and can further predict virologic outcomes among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). Zidovudine, one of the mainstream antiretrovirals in China, has been verified to have high reliability in adherence assessment, especially for its hair concentrations. However, data are limited in its predicting virologic outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize whether hair zidovudine concentrations can predict virologic suppression among Chinese PLWH compared with hair lamivudine concentrations and two self-reported measures, the overall frequency of adherence behaviors and percentage adherence. Methods: This cross-sectional study randomly recruited 564 PLWH currently treated with zidovudine, lamivudine, and other ART agents (efavirenz, nevirapine, or lopinavir/ritonavir) in Guangxi, China. Hair antiretroviral concentrations were determined using the LC-ESI(+)-MS/MS method. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to estimate the optimal classification thresholds of hair concentrations of zidovudine and lamivudine, and the two self-reported measures. Based on those optimal classification thresholds, logistic regression was used to examine whether those four adherence measures can predict virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA &lt;200 copies/mL). Results: ROC curves demonstrated good classification performance for association with virologic suppression of zidovudine with the optimal threshold at 58 pg/mg and lamivudine at 255 pg/mg but no self-reported measures. PLWH with hair zidovudine concentrations &gt;58 pg/mg had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 43.191 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 10.171‒183.418, p &lt; 0.001) for virologic suppression. Hair lamivudine concentrations were also associated with virologic suppression (aOR = 10.656, 95% CI = 3.670‒30.943, p &lt; 0.001). However, two self-reported measures did not predict virologic suppression (aORs = 1.157 and 2.488, ps &gt;0.149). Conclusion: Hair zidovudine concentrations can be served as an alternative tool for clinically predicting virologic suppression among PLWH in China.</td>

      <td>Background: Gram-positive cocci are clinically important pathogens that cause infections and their development of antibiotic resistance continues to pose a severe threat to public health. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the level of antimicrobial resistance among Gram-positive cocci isolated from different clinical samples among patients referred to Arsho Advanced Medical Laboratory, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods: From January to April 2018, a cross-sectional study was conducted at Arsho Advanced Medical Laboratory. Seven hundred ninety-two (792) different clinical samples were obtained from 792 individuals and inoculated into blood culture bottles and Blood Agar base. Bacterial identification was done using the number, type, and morphology of colonies, as well as Gram staining, catalase testing, and coagulase test after isolation of pure growth on culture media using the standard operating procedure. VITEK 2 compact system was used for bacterial identification and drug susceptibility testing. The information entry and analysis were performed by using SPSS version 20. Results: Out of 792 clinical samples cultured, the prevalence of Gram-positive cocci was 12.6% (n=100/792). The most frequent one is S. aureus 54% (n=54/100) followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species 42% (n=42/100), S. agalactiae 1% (n=1/100) and E. faecalis 3% (n=3/100). Penicillin showed the highest resistance rate 85% (n=85/100), followed by sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (47%), and oxacillin (38%); however, highest sensitivity was seen towards linezolid 97% (n=97/100) and vancomycin 94% (n=94/ 100). The total multi-drug resistance (MDR) Gram-positive cocci were 44% (n=44/100). Conclusion: This study demonstrated high antimicrobial resistance and multi-drug resistance. This suggests that the importance of continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance patterns is crucial for selecting the suitable drug for treatment and infection prevention.</td>

The lesion position first appeared on upper right lung and then spread to the fourth lumbar vertebra. The result of periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) and Gomori’s methenamine silver (GMS) staining of the tissue sample matched cryptococcal infection, but multiple culture was negative. Eventually, C. neoformans var. grubii was confirmed using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Current follow-up of 12 months indicated a stable condition after antifungal therapy (fluconazole 400 mg/day) combined with surgery.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary teaching hospital in Henan Province, China, between January 2018 and December 2021. All BSIs caused by CRKP in hospitalized HM patients were identified. Data on patient demographics, disease, laboratory tests, treatment regimens, outcomes of infection, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of each isolate were collected from medical records. Results: A total of 129 patients with CRKP BSI were included in the study, and the 28-day mortality rate was 80.6% (104/129). In Cox analysis an absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500 at discharge (hazard ratio [HR] 6.386, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.074–13.266, p &lt; 0.001), intensive care unit admission (HR 1.834, 95% CI 1.065–3.157, p = 0.029), and higher Pitt bacteremia score (HR 1.185, 95% CI 1.118–1.255, p &lt; 0.001) were independent risk factors associated with 28-day mortality. Survival curve analysis indicated that compared with ceftazidime-avibactam-based therapy, both polymyxin b (HR 8.175, 95% CI 1.099–60.804, p = 0.040) and tigecycline (HR 14.527, 95% CI 2.000–105.541, p =0.008) were associated with a higher risk of mortality. Conclusion: In HM patients CRKP BSI resulted in high mortality. Intensive care unit admission, higher Pitt bacteremia score, and absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500 at discharge were independently associated with higher mortality. Early initiation of new agents such as ceftazidime-avibactam may improve outcomes.</td>

      <td>Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae infection is still the world’s most serious public health problem among children under the age of five. Nasopharyngeal carriage rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae has been identified as an important risk factor for the acquisition of community acquired respiratory tract infection. To date, little is known about the nasopharyngeal infection and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Streptococcus pneumoniae among preschool children in Ethiopia. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Streptococcus pneumoniae among preschool children. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2021 to April 2022. A total of 418 preschool children were enrolled using a multistage sampling technique. Nasopharyngeal swab was collected and transported to Medical Microbiology Laboratory at Debre Berhan comprehensive specialized hospital using skim-milk tryptone glucose glycerol transport media. The swab was inoculated on blood agar plates supplemented with 5µg/mL gentamycin and incubated at 37°C for 24–48 hours under 5% CO2 using a candle jar. Identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae was performed using Gram stain, catalase test, optochin test and bile solubility test. Antimicrobial sensitivity tests were done using a modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Data were entered into the statistical package Epi data 4.0.0.6 and transferred to and analyzed using SPSS software version-23. A P-value ≤0.05 with 95% CI was considered to be statistically significant. Results: The prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae nasopharyngeal carriage was 29.9% (125/418). The overall rate of multidrug resistance was 86 (68.8%), with tetracycline (68.8%) and TMP-SMX (68%). Among risk factors, young age and passive smoking were associated with pneumococcal carriage. Conclusion: The present study revealed a substantially lower prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae nasopharyngeal carriage. High antimicrobial resistance was observed for most antimicrobial drugs tested. Younger age groups and passive smokers were at risk of Streptococcus pneumoniae nasopharyngeal carriage.</td>

      <td>Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most prevalent infections, with a variety of etiologic agents, a high number of occurrences, relapses, and complications; also, antibiotic resistance of the pathogenic bacterium is a hugely significant challenge for physicians. Objective: The goal of this research was to identify the common bacterial uropathogens as well as their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. Materials and Methods: During the first six months of 2018, a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on urine samples of 1780 patients at FMIC based on culture. Bacterial typing was performed using cystine lactose electrolyte deficient agar and blood agar, and Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion was employed to assess the sensitivity of the bacteria to various antibiotics. Results: Among 1780 patients in 341 (19.15%) samples, uropathogens were isolated. E. coli (63.9%), Enterococcus (11.1%), Serratia species (10.8%), Staphylococcus species (8.2%), Klebsiella (2.9%), Proteus species (1.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.2%) were the most common bacterial uropathogens. More than two-thirds of patients were female (69.6%), with the remaining 30.4% male. Ampicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin were the antibiotics with the highest resistance rates in bacterial uropathogens, at 92.6%, 82.9%, and 82.1%, respectively. Furthermore, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefixime, and sulfamethoxazole were antibiotics with resistance rates exceeding 70%. The antibiotics pristinamycin and ticarcillin were the most sensitive, with a TRR of zero. Ertapenem, imipenem, amikacin, tazobactam, fosfomycin, vancomycin, and nitrofurantoin were the antibiotics with the lowest resistance rates (less than 10%). Conclusion: E. coli was the most common bacterial uropathogen isolated in this study, followed by Enterococcus species. Our findings suggest that physicians, particularly in FMIC, consider E. coli, Enterococcus, Serratia and Staphylococcus as the most common bacteria, and use pristinamycin, ticarcillin, ertapenem, imipenem, amikacin, tazobactam, fosfomycin, vancomycin, and nitrofurantoin as sensitive antibiotics in empirical UTI treatment.</td>

      <td>An Overview of the Diagnosis and Management of Seborrheic Dermatitis</td>
      <td>Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder that mostly affects young adults in areas rich in sebaceous glands (scalp, face, and trunk). In adolescents and adults, SD clinical presentation may range from mild patches to diffuse scalp scaling. In infants, it mainly occurs on the scalp as yellowish, scaly patches (“cradle cap”). In adults, several environmental triggers are likely to promote SD development, along with fungal colonization by Malassezia spp., sebaceous gland activity, as well as immunosuppression, endocrine, neurogenic and iatrogenic factors. In children, early occurrence in the first trimester suggests the role of excessive sebaceous gland activity from maternal hormones, along with cutaneous microbiome alterations. The diagnosis of SD is usually clinical, and specific laboratory and/or instrumental investigations are seldom required. Treatment is aimed at modulating sebum production, reducing skin colonization by Malassezia spp., and controlling inflammation. In adults, mild-to-moderate scalp SD forms can be managed with topical antifungals (ketoconazole, ciclopirox, miconazole) or antiinflammatory (mild-to-moderate potency corticosteroids) or keratolytic/humectant (propylene glycol) agents. Recommended topical therapeutic options for mild-to-moderate facial or body areas SD include topical ketoconazole, ciclopirox, clotrimazole, mild-to-moderate potency corticosteroids, lithium succinate/gluconate, and topical calcineurin inihibitors (off-label use). In severe and/or resistant cases, the use of systemic antifungal drugs (terbinafine, itraconazole), as well as UVB phototherapy, may be considered. In children, scant scientific evidence supports the effectiveness and safety of topical drugs, and “cradle cap” is usually successfully managed with baby shampoos enriched with emollient agents and vegetable oils. Alternatively, similarly to adult scalp SD, medical device shampoos with antiinflammatory and antifungal properties, containing piroctone olamine, bisabolol, alyglicera, telmesteine, may be used. Beyond pharmacological treat-ments, an appropriate cosmetic approach, if correctly prescribed, may improve therapeutic outcomes.</td>

In the present study, we aim to investigate the colonization-related risk factors and molecular epidemiological characteristics of CRE in patients with acute leukemia. Methods: From January 2021 to December 2021, acute leukemia patients were screened for CRE by fecal/perianal swabs. We identified the species, carbapenemase-encoding genes, and virulence genes of the colonizing strains and performed antimicrobial susceptibility tests and ERIC-PCR typing. Risk factors for CRE colonization were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: We collected a total of 21 colonizing strains from 320 patients. All strains were resistant to meropenem. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most abundant species, and ERIC-PCR typing showed low diversity. Univariate analysis showed that age, cephalosporins, penicillins, tigecyclines, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation status were risk factors for CRE colonization; simultaneously discovered CRE strains played a dominant role in invasive infection of colonized patients. Logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that age, cephalosporins, and tigecyclines were independent risk factors for CRE intestinal colonization. Conclusion: CRE colonization can increase the incidence of CRE infection in patients with acute leukemia. Early detection of CRE colonization through CRE screening is an important measure to control the spread of CRE.</td>

Ideal anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates should be screened to prevent secondary injury to the lungs. Here, we propose that in vitro three-dimensional organoid and lung injury repair mouse models are powerful models for the screening antiviral drugs. Lung epithelial progenitor cells, including airway club cells and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, were co-cultured with supportive fibroblast cells in transwell inserts. The organoid model was used to evaluate the possible effects of hydroxychloroquine, which is administered as a symptomatic therapy to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, on the function of mouse lung stem/progenitor cells. Hydroxychloroquine was observed to promote the self-renewal of club cells and differentiation of ciliated and goblet cells in vitro. Additionally, it inhibited the self-renewal ability of AT2 cells in vitro. Naphthalene-or bleomycin-induced lung injury repair mouse models were used to investigate the in vivo effects of hydroxychloroquine on the regeneration of club and AT2 cells, respectively. The naphthalene model indicated that the proliferative ability and differentiation potential of club cells were unaffected in the presence of hydroxychloroquine. The bleomycin model suggested that hydroxychloroquine had a limited effect on the proliferation and differentiation abilities of AT2 cells. These findings suggest that hydroxychloroquine has limited effects on the regenerative ability of epithelial stem/progenitor cells. Thus, stem/ progenitor cell-derived organoid technology and lung epithelial injury repair mouse models provide a powerful platform for drug screening, which could possibly help end the pandemic.</td>

      <td>Background: Self-medication is to obtain and consume the drugs without the advice of a physician about the diagnosis and treatment. Medical students are different from the general population because of their exposure to numerous clinical cases and also the knowledge about diseases, diagnosis and drugs. Aim and Objectives: The objective of the study was to evaluate the self-medication practices among undergraduate medical students in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 150 undergraduate medical students at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Adilabad from September 2021 to November 2021 after obtaining approval from Institutional Ethics Committee. A structured and validated questionnaire was used to collect information regarding self-medication practices. The study was based on their knowledge and attitude about the practice of self-medication. Results: 150 students participated in the study. Out of 150 students, 136 practiced self-medication. Of them 86 were female and 50 were male. The most common reason which lead to the practice of self-medication was their convenience. Fever was the most common indication for self-medication. Paracetamol was the most common analgesic and Azithromycin was the most common antibiotic used for self-medication. Nausea was the most common among adverse drug reactions experienced by the students. Conclusion: This practice of self-medication masks the sign and symptoms of underlying pathology, and thus complicates and delays the diagnosis. It also creates drug resistance. The practice of self-medication assumes a special significance among the medical students as they will be the future medical practitioners and play a crucial role in counseling the patients about the practice and adverse effects associated with self-medication.</td>

Results: Among total of 114 subjects (68 males, 46 females), majority were young (56.14%, &lt;33 y). Most common diagnosis was tinea cruris followed by combination of tinea cruris and corporis. Average monthly family income was 11469.29 ± 10027.5 INR. Brand prescription was (74.15%), higher than generic (25.84%). Oral formulations were more prescribed (54.83%) than topical (45.16%) whereas individually luliconazole (cream) topped (23.18%) in the list. No topical or systemic steroid was prescribed. The commonest drug regimen was capsule itraconazole, luliconazole cream, and cetirizine or levocetirizine tablet with or without ketoconazole soap or tea tree body wash (71/114, 62.28%). About 39.47% subjects practiced self-medication, topical steroids (37.20%) mostly used. Price variability (percentage) among brands of the same drug was highest in ketoconazole soap (138.66%), followed by terbinafine tablet 250 mg (89.50%) followed by itraconazole capsule (83.33%). Conclusion: Luliconazole cream, itraconazole (capsule/tablet), terbinafine (tablet) and ketoconazole soap were the highly prescribed antifungal agents whereas topical steroid was mostly preferred as self-medication. Prescription of generic drugs should be promoted as well as inappropriate use of self-medication should be discouraged among the prescribers and the patients respectively.</td>

      <td>Cabotegravir/Rilpivirine: the last FDA-approved drug to treat HIV</td>
      <td>Introduction: The development of long-acting (LA) drugs has changed the management of common medical conditions for human replication immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Cabenuva (cabotegravir/Rilpivirine) is the first LA antiretroviral injectable drug composed of nano-formulation of cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV). Areas covered: In this review article, we aim to have a brief overview of results of major clinical trials that administrated Cabotegravir/Rilpivirine for patients considering the efficacy and safety profiles. Moreover, we discuss about CAB and RPV chemical structure, mechanism of action, activity against drug-sensitive and -resistant HIV, and pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics properties. Expert opinion: Based on the results of the ATLAS and FLAIR trials, Cabotegravir/Rilpivirine regimen once-monthly has shown equal effectivity to oral combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in maintaining HIV-1 suppression in patients. Furthermore, ATLAS-2 M study revealed the non-inferiority of Cabotegravir/Rilpivirine regimen every 8 weeks compared to every 4 weeks. The injectable LA ART reduces the number of treatment intake as well as increases adherence, especially in patients with HIV-related stigma. Administration of extended-release agents probably minimize the risk of treatment-related toxicity and resistance related to sub-optimal adherence to oral ART, so Cabotegravir/Rilpivirine can be suggested as a suitable alternative for HIV infection control in current era.</td>

      <td>Phytochemical studies of methanol soluble fractions of Abrus precatorius Linn (Fabaceae) led to the isolation of four abruquinones (abruquinones M, A, E, and B). Structures of the compounds were elucidated using spectroscopic analyses - 1D, 2D NMR, HRESI-MS. Evaluation of the therapeutic effects of A. precatorius fractions showed significant (p &lt; 0.05) antibacterial and antiurease activities. Further therapeutic evaluation of the compounds showed that abruquinones M, A, E, and B demonstrated antibacterial activities by inhibiting significantly (p &lt; 0.05) the growth of multidrug resistant S. aureus (MIC values ranged from 20 - 30 μg/mL) (µM) via induction of morphological damages with concomitant membrane segmentation. Abruquinones A and B showed significant (p &lt; 0.05) urease inhibiting activity (IC(50) values 35.2 and 37.7 µM, respectively), docked tightly to the side chains of urease enzyme active site via π-cation interactions, as well as showed cytotoxicity against AU565 and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells (IC(50) values 23.13 and 9.05 μM, respectively). These findings suggest abruquinones (isoflavanquinones) from A. precatorius roots as viable candidates for further mechanistic studies on possible antibacterial, antiurease, and anticancer drug development.</td>

      <td>Gut dysbiosis and the clinical spectrum in anti-Ro positive mothers of children with neonatal lupus</td>
      <td>Anti-SSA/Ro antibodies, while strongly linked to fetal cardiac injury and neonatal rash, can associate with a spectrum of disease in the mother, ranging from completely asymptomatic to overt Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or Sjögren’s Syndrome (SS). This study was initiated to test the hypothesis that the microbiome, influenced in part by genetics, contributes to disease state. The stool microbiome of healthy controls (HC) was compared to that of anti-SSA/Ro positive women whose children had neonatal lupus. At the time of sampling, these women were either asymptomatic (Asym), had minor rheumatic symptoms or signs considered as an undifferentiated autoimmune syndrome (UAS), or were diagnosed with SLE or SS. Differences in microbial relative abundances among these three groups were tested assuming an ordering in clinical severity (HC&lt;Asym/UAS&lt;SS/SLE) and then again without the ordinal assumption. Those taxa that showed differential relative abundances were then tested for whether the effect size differed depending on the women’s HLA SLE-risk allele genotype (DRB1*03:01, DRB1*15:01, DQB1*02:01 and DQB1*06:02) or anti-SSA/Ro autoantibody levels. Multiple genera within the families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae showed evidence of an HLA-by-genus interaction (P &lt; .05). Four genera exhibited evidence of an interaction with anti-Ro52 IgA: Lachnoclostridium, Romboutsia, Bacteroides and Actinomyces (P &lt; .01). In addition to documenting differences in microbial relative abundances across clinical severity of disease, these data provide a first-time demonstration that microbial differences are correlated with HLA SLE-risk alleles. Taken together, these data suggest that the clinical spectrum from benign to overt clinical autoimmunity may partially result from or trigger a complex interplay among specific microbial profiles, anti-Ro autoantibodies, and genetics.</td>

      <td>Poor adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy and associated factors among people living with HIV in Eastern Ethiopia</td>
      <td>Objective: Sustained adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy is necessary to suppress viral replication and improve immunological and clinical outcomes. Although different studies tried to identify factors affecting adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy, there are few studies after initiation of test and start strategy and the first-line drug regimen change in the study area. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the level of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy and associated factors among people living with HIV in Eastern Ethiopia. Methods: Institutional-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from 2 March 2020, to 30 March 2020. A total of 501 study participants were recruited using systematic random sampling. Data were collected using face-to-face interviews at the end of the clinic visit and a review of participants’ medical records. The level of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy was measured using the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. The score ranges from 0 to 8, and a score of less than 8 indicates poor adherence. The data were entered into EpiData and exported to STATA for further analysis. The binary logistic regression analysis model was employed to identify associated factors. The association was reported with an adjusted odds ratio and a 95% confidence level. The significance level was declared at p = 0.05. Results: A total of 501 participants participated in the study, giving a response rate of 98.2%. The majority (314 or 62.7%) of study participants were females. The participants’ mean (standard deviation) age was 38.17 (8.75). The level of poor adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy was found to be 33.73% (confidence interval: 29.70, 38.00). Age category 35 to 44 (1.65 (confidence interval: 1.02, 2.69)), no shortage of highly active antiretroviral therapy (0.46 (confidence interval: 0.28, 0.75)), substance use (1.67 (confidence interval: 1.11, 2.25)), having moderate depressive symptoms (4.00 (confidence interval: 1.94, 8.48)), and moderate anxiety symptoms (5.22 (confidence interval: 2.31, 8.84)) were significantly associated with the poor adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy among adult people living with HIV. Conclusion: The level of poor adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy was found to be high in this study. Poor adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy was significantly associated with age, availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy drugs, substance usage, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Improving the adherence levels requires stringent counseling, assuring continuous drug availability, and timely screening and management of depression and anxiety.</td>

      <td>As global studies report varying trends in antibiotic susceptibility of uropathogens, it is necessary to have current and constant information on the prevalence of urinary tract infections, the causative pathogens, and their susceptibility profiles, for effective management in specific geographical settings. This prospective cross-sectional study focused on the prevalence of urinary tract infections, etiological agents, and their antibiogram in a secondary and tertiary care hospital in Northern Ghana. Urine samples collected from 219 patients of all age groups were cultured on cysteine lactose electrolyte deficient agar. Pathogens were identified following standard microbiological methods, and their susceptibility to antibiotics was determined by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Approximately 34% of the patients had significant bacteria, but the prevalence was slightly higher (P =.763) in the Tertiary care hospital (37.3%) than in the Secondary hospital (30.3%). Patients who were 60 years and above (27.0%) were commonly found with UTIs followed by the year group 20 to 29 years (20.3%). Although all the diagnoses had a positive relationship with urinary tract infection except Pyelonephritis, none of the underlying conditions was a significant (P &gt;.05) predictor of urinary tract infection, with the odds ratio indicating that patients with hyperparathyroidism and dysuria had 2.606 times more likely increased risk or predictor of urinary tract infection. Ten different pathogens were identified, but Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus were frequently encountered. Gram-negative isolates generally showed more resistance. High resistance against ampicillin (100%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (88.5%), chloramphenicol (84.6%), augmentin (69.2%), ceftriaxone (69.2%), and ciprofloxacin (61.5%) were recorded. Amikacin was relatively effective against isolated pathogens. The high records of resistance among uropathogens and the occurrence of multidrug resistance (92%) reiterate the urgent call for rigorous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among infectious pathogens in Ghana.</td>

      <td>Background: Antipsychotics are the treatment of choice in the therapy of schizophrenia. These drugs can be associated with changes in heart rate, but this question has never been examined systematically. Objective: We aimed to analyse changes in heart rate during treatment with antipsychotics using the frequency of tachycardia and bradycardia events. Design: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included all randomized controlled trials for the acute treatment of schizophrenia comparing antipsychotics head-to-head or with placebo. Data Sources and Methods: We searched Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, BIOSIS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov (last search June 2021). Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We conducted pairwise meta-analyses using a random-effects model. Outcomes were tachycardia and bradycardia events. Results: We found 469 trials meeting the inclusion criteria. Seventy-seven studies with 16,907 participants provided data on tachycardia or bradycardia events. We found no significant differences between antipsychotics and placebo or between antipsychotics for bradycardia events based on sparse data. Antipsychotics had a higher risk for tachycardia events compared with placebo [N = 37, n = 7827, risk ratio (RR) = 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.40–2.41], with large differences between the individual substances (iloperidone RR = 14.05, chlorpromazine RR = 4.84, loxapine RR = 4.52, risperidone RR = 3.38, quetiapine RR = 2.64, paliperidone RR = 1.65). Some head-to-head comparisons were also significantly different: olanzapine versus haloperidol RR = 2.87, chlorpromazine versus thiothixene RR = 2.92, quetiapine versus lurasidone RR = 3.22, risperidone versus aripiprazole RR = 4.37, iloperidone versus ziprasidone RR = 4.65). Conclusion: Many studies do not report data for cardiac outcomes, but the available evidence indicates that treatment with antipsychotics raises the risk for tachycardia. Therefore, especially patients with cardiac risk factors should be monitored closely during antipsychotic treatment. Registration: PROSPERO: CRD42014014919.</td>

      <td>Objectives: To evaluate the impact of a treatment switch to dolutegravir plus lamivudine on the soluble inflammatory biomarkers of HIV-infected patients treated in a real-life setting. Materials and methods: This was a longitudinal study that enrolled virologically-suppressed patients on stable 3-drug ART who switched at baseline to dolutegravir + lamivudine (2DR-group), based on the clinician’s decision, or maintained triple therapy (3DR-group). Subjects in the 3DR-group were matched with those in the 2DR-group for age, gender and type of anchor drug. Plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), I-FABP, D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) were quantified by a microfluidic ultrasensitive ELISA assay at baseline and at 48 weeks. Results: Overall 208 subjects were enrolled: 101 in the 2DR-group and 107 in the 3DR-group. At baseline, biomarker levels were comparable between groups. The differences in mean log(10) change from baseline to 48 weeks between groups (2DR versus 3DR) were: IL-6 (pg/L) −0.051(95% CI −0.115/0.009) versus 0.004 (95% CI −0.046/0.054) (p = 0.159); I-FABP (pg/mL), −0.088 (95% CI −0.14/-0.041) versus 0.033 (95%CI −0.007/0.072) (p &lt; 0.001); D-dimer (pg/mL), −0.011(95% CI-0.055/0.033) versus −0.021 (95% CI −0.071/0.030) (p = 0.780) and CRP (pg/mL), −0.028 (95%CI −0.118/0.063) versus 0.118 (95% CI 0.024/0.211) (p = 0.028). Conclusions: At 1 year, switching to a dolutegravir plus lamivudine dual regimen in this setting showed a favorable trend for two biomarkers analyzed, i.e., I-FABP and CRP, as compared to continuing a triple therapy. These results add important new data in support of the safety of this approach in terms of its effect on the inflammatory milieu.</td>

      <td>Background: Intracranial abscesses have been a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge since time immemorial for both the microbiologists and the neurosurgeons. There is paucity of detailed studies documenting the infecting organism causing brain abscesses in South India. Aims: The study aimed at identifying and assessing the prevalence of aerobic, anaerobic bacteria and fungi associated with brain abscesses at a tertiary care hospital in South India. Methods and Material: Eight years data was collected from the records of culture reports from 2007 to 2010 and 2013 to 2018. The corresponding clinical case records were retrieved for the assessment of risk factors. Risk factors of brain abscess development were assessed based on clinical cases records. Results: Data from 140 brain abscess cases obtained over a period of 8 years were analyzed. Out of the 140 samples, 66 (47.14%) were culture positive in which 33 (50%) had single aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria, 20 (30.3%) had mixture of more than one aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria, 12 (18.18%) had single obligate anaerobic bacteria and 1(1.5%) sample had Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated. Among the total 92 isolates, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21/92, 23%) and Staphylococcus aureus (20/92, 22%) predominated. Bacteroides fragilis group was the most common obligate anaerobe isolated. There were no fungal isolates. As there were various isolates isolated, hence there is heterogeneity of isolates detected Neuroanatomically, parietal lobe (45/140, 32%) was the most common location. Otogenic infection was the major risk factor for parietal and temporal lobe abscess (P value &lt;.05). Conclusions: It has become essential for the microbiologists to be aware of unusual isolates from brain abscess and its complex nature. Obscurity and difficulty in their microbiological diagnosis calls for more such detailed studies.</td>

When impaired, elevated heme biosynthesis precursor levels accumulate in the liver, resulting in neurological symptoms, psychiatric disturbances, darkened urine color, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and ileus. We present a 22-year-old Hispanic female with diffuse abdominal pain and no bowel movements for 8 days. She reported recent antibiotic and oral contraceptive pill use. Computerized tomography of her abdomen revealed a dilated small bowel and marked colonic distension. A colonoscopy found mild nonspecific inflammation in the rectosigmoid and terminal ileum. Her abdominal pain persisted despite interventions and improvements in appetite, bowel movements, abdominal imaging, and treatment of an identified Clostridium difficile infection. A random urine porphobilinogen was then obtained and found to be elevated. Fractionation of plasma and urine porphyrins was suggestive of AIP. Her symptoms improved with 3 days of intravenous (IV) hematin and IV dextrose. This is a unique case of a rare disease due to her clinical presentation with ileus, unremarkable past medical history, family history, and the prehospitalization and intrahospitalization factors that likely exacerbated the patient AIP.</td>

Pathogenicity is a factor dependent on the virulence of the microorganisms. The study aimed at determining the virulence markers and factors in multidrug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli isolated from patients with urinary tract and gastrointestinal tract infections in Lafia, Nigeria. Collection of urine and stool samples (150 each) from patients was carried out, and bacteria isolated from the samples using the spread plate technique. Antibiotic susceptibility test was determined to identify resistant E. coli isolates after which, virulence factors and genes conferring virulence evaluated. The prevalence of E. coli was 33.3% and 35.3% in urine and stool respectively with 42 of the isolates being MDR. All the isolates showed cell surface hydrophobicity on ammonia sulfate molarity at &gt;1.5, and all possessed capacity to produce hemolysin and pyrogen, though isolate U6 produced the highest amount of hemolysin and the other isolates mostly produced reasonable amount of pyrogen. Isolate U19 from urine sample and isolates S6, S10, S11, and S17 from stool samples all had between 81 and 100 serum resistance survival percentages, while 13 of the isolates had no serum resistance capabilities.

      <td>Levodopa–entacapone–carbidopa intestinal gel infusion in advanced Parkinson’s disease: real-world experience and practical guidance</td>
      <td>As Parkinson’s disease (PD) progresses, treatment needs to be adapted to maintain symptom control. Once patients develop advanced PD, an optimised regimen of oral and transdermal medications may no longer provide adequate relief of OFF periods and motor complications can emerge. At this point, patients may wish to consider a device-aided therapy (DAT) that provides continuous dopaminergic stimulation to help overcome these issues. Levodopa–entacapone–carbidopa intestinal gel (LECIG) infusion is a recently developed DAT option. The aim of this article is twofold: (1) to give an overview of the pharmacokinetics of LECIG infusion and clinical experience to date of its use in patients with advanced PD, including real-world data and patient-reported outcomes from a cohort of patients treated in Sweden, the first country where it was introduced, and (2) based on that information to provide practical guidance for healthcare teams starting patients on LECIG infusion, whether they are transitioning from oral medications or from other DATs, including recommendations for stepwise dosing calculation and titration. In terms of clinical efficacy, LECIG infusion has been shown to have a similar effect on motor function to standard levodopa–carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) infusion but, due to the presence of entacapone in LECIG, the bioavailability of levodopa is increased such that lower overall levodopa doses can be given to achieve therapeutically effective plasma concentrations. From a practical standpoint, LECIG infusion is delivered using a smaller cartridge and pump system than LCIG infusion. In addition, for patients previously treated with LCIG infusion who have an existing percutaneous endoscopic transgastric jejunostomy (PEG-J) system, this is compatible with the LECIG infusion system. As it is a relatively new product, the long-term efficacy and safety of LECIG infusion remain to be established; however, real-world data will continue to be collected and analysed to provide this information and help inform future clinical decisions.</td>

      <td>Epidemiological and genetic characteristics of clinical carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains collected countrywide from hospital intensive care units (ICUs) in China</td>
      <td>Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the key Gram-negative pathogens that can cause serious nosocomial infections. In China, a large proportion of clinical A. baumannii strains are multidrug resistant, among which strains resistant to carbapenems are particularly worrisome, as infections caused by such strains may limit the choice of existing antibiotics. We conducted a nationwide and genome-based surveillance on the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility profile of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) strains collected from intensive care units (ICUs) in hospitals in different provinces and investigated the routes of transmission and mechanism of resistance by whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. We found that CRAB strains were prevalent in 71.4% (55/77) of the ICUs surveyed. Clonal spread of CRAB was found in 37.6% (29/77) of ICUs and a total of 22 different clones were identified. Most clones were transmissible within one ICU, but up to six clones could be detected in at least three hospitals. In addition, carbapenem-hydrolysing class D β-lactamases (CHDL) were found to be mainly responsible for carbapenem-resistance in A. baumannii and the ST2 global-clone is the predominant type of CRAB in China. Importantly, we found that CRAB isolates currently exhibited an extremely low rate of resistance to colistin (0.4%) and tigecycline (2.5%), but a high rate of resistance to ceftazidime–avibactam (70.2%). Findings in this work shall facilitate development of appropriate antimicrobial regimens for treatment of CRAB infections. Further surveillance and research on the evolutionary and epidemiological features of clinical CRAB strains are necessary.</td>

      <td>Eravacycline (Erava) is a synthetic fluorocycline with potent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria. This study aimed to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and resistance mechanism of Erava in clinical E. faecium isolates from China. Erava minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against clinical E. faecium isolates—including those resistant to linezolid (LZD) or harboring the tetracycline (Tet) resistance genes was ≤0.25 mg l(−1). Moreover, our data indicated that clinical isolates of E. faecium with Erava MIC 0.25 mg l(−1) were predominantly shown to belong to Sequence-type 78 (ST78) and ST80. The prevalence of Erava heteroresistance in clinical E. faecium strain was 2.46% (3/122). The increased Erava MIC values of heteroresistance-derived E. faecium clones could be significantly reduced by efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs). Furthermore, comparative proteomics results showed that efflux pumps lmrA, mdlA, and mdlB contributed significantly to the acquisition of Erava resistance in E. faecium. In addition, a genetic mutation in 16 S rRNA (G190A) were detected in resistant E. faecium isolates induced by Erava. In summary, Erava exhibits potent in vitro antimicrobial activity against E. faecium, but mutation of Tet target sites and elevated expression of efflux pumps under Erava selection results in Erava resistance.</td>

      <td>Pramipexole inhibits astrocytic NLRP3 inflammasome activation via Drd3-dependent autophagy in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease</td>
      <td>Inflammation is one of the pathogenic processes in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Dopamine receptor agonist pramipexole (PPX) is extensively used for PD treatment in clinics. A number of studies show that PPX exerts neuroprotection on dopaminergic (DA) neurons, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of PPX on DA neurons are not fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated whether PPX modulated PD-related neuroinflammation and underlying mechanisms. PD model was established in mice by bilateral striatum injection of lipopolyssaccharide (LPS). The mice were administered PPX (0.5 mg·kg(−1)·d(−1), i.p.) 3 days before LPS injection, and for 3 or 21 days after surgery, respectively, for biochemical and histological analyses. We showed that PPX administration significantly alleviated the loss of DA neurons, and suppressed the astrocyte activation and levels of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β in the substantia nigra of LPS-injected mice. Furthermore, PPX administration significantly decreased the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-associated proteins, i.e., cleaved forms of caspase-1, IL-1β, and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruit domain (ASC) in the striatum. These results were validated in LPS+ATP-stimulated primary mouse astrocytes in vitro. Remarkably, we showed that PPX (100–400 μM) dose-dependently enhanced the autophagy activity in the astrocytes evidenced by the elevations in LC3-II and BECN1 protein expression, as well as the increase of GFP-LC3 puncta formation. The opposite effects of PPX on astrocytic NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy were eliminated by Drd3 depletion. Moreover, we demonstrated that both pretreatment of astrocytes with autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (40 μM) in vitro and astrocyte-specific Atg5 knockdown in vivo blocked PPX-caused inhibition on NLRP3 inflammasome and protection against DA neuron damage. Altogether, this study demonstrates an anti-neuroinflammatory activity of PPX via a Drd3-dependent enhancement of autophagy activity in astrocytes, and reveals a new mechanism for the beneficial effect of PPX in PD therapy.</td>

      <td>Clinically Relevant Interactions Between Ritonavir-Boosted Nirmatrelvir and Concomitant Antiseizure Medications: Implications for the Management of COVID-19 in Patients with Epilepsy</td>
      <td>Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (RBN) has been authorized recently in several countries as an orally active anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment for patients at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 disease. Nirmatrelvir is the active component against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, whereas ritonavir, a potent CYP3A inhibitor, is intended to boost the activity of nirmatrelvir by increasing its concentration in plasma to ensure persistence of antiviral concentrations during the 12-hour dosing interval. RBN is involved in many clinically important drug–drug interactions both as perpetrator and as victim, which can complicate its use in patients treated with antiseizure medications (ASMs). Interactions between RBN and ASMs are bidirectional. As perpetrator, RBN may increase the plasma concentration of a number of ASMs that are CYP3A4 substrates, possibly leading to toxicity. As victims, both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are subject to metabolic induction by concomitant treatment with potent enzyme-inducing ASMs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and primidone). According to US and European prescribing information, treatment with these ASMs is a contraindication to the use of RBN. Although remdesivir is a valuable alternative to RBN, it may not be readily accessible in some settings due to cost and/or need for intravenous administration. If remdesivir is not an appropriate option, either bebtelovimab or molnupiravir may be considered. However, evidence about the clinical efficacy of bebtelovimab is still limited, and molnupiravir, the only orally active alternative, is deemed to have appreciably lower efficacy than RBN and remdesivir.</td>

      <td>Cannabidiol for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder: hope or hype?</td>
      <td>Rationale: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined as a group of neurodevelopmental disorders whose symptoms include impaired communication and social interaction, restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, and varying levels of intellectual disability. ASD is observed in early childhood and is one of the most severe chronic childhood disorders in prevalence, morbidity, and impact on society. It is usually accompanied by attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and epilepsy. The treatment of ASD has low efficacy, possibly because it has a heterogeneous nature, and its neurobiological basis is not clearly understood. Drugs such as risperidone and aripiprazole are the only two drugs available that are recognized by the Food and Drug Administration, primarily for treating the behavioral symptoms of this disorder. These drugs have limited efficacy and a high potential for inducing undesirable effects, compromising treatment adherence. Therefore, there is great interest in exploring the endocannabinoid system, which modulates the activity of other neurotransmitters, has actions in social behavior and seems to be altered in patients with ASD. Thus, cannabidiol (CBD) emerges as a possible strategy for treating ASD symptoms since it has relevant pharmacological actions on the endocannabinoid system and shows promising results in studies related to disorders in the central nervous system. Objectives: Review the preclinical and clinical data supporting CBD’s potential as a treatment for the symptoms and comorbidities associated with ASD, as well as discuss and provide information with the purpose of not trivializing the use of this drug.</td>

      <td>Dose-response analysis of aripiprazole in patients with schizophrenia in Taiwan</td>
      <td>Background: Aripiprazole is a third-generation antipsychotic agent with acceptable efficacy and a good safety profile. Previous studies have indicated the therapeutic serum concentration of aripiprazole to be 100 to 350 ng/ml; however, most of these studies examined a Western population. Patients with schizophrenia from Tungs’ Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital in central Taiwan were recruited to analyze the dose–response relationship of aripiprazole in the Chinese population. Objective: We aimed to investigate whether a serum concentration of aripiprazole higher than the current suggested range leads to higher response rates. Design: A prospective cohort study was designed to investigate the response rates in different studied cohorts grouped by serum concentration of aripiprazole. Data Sources and Methods: Data of 64 patients who presented to a single medical center in central Taiwan and who received therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) were obtained. Serum concentrations of aripiprazole were correlated with the clinical response of patients by using the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scores. Results: The mean concentration of aripiprazole was 432.1 ± 275.1 ng/ml in the study cohort. Among the much-improved patients, the mean serum concentration of aripiprazole was 494 ± 273 ng/ml (25th–75th percentiles 264–666 ng/ml), which was higher than the current recommended therapeutic target of 100–350 ng/ml for aripiprazole. The response rate in the severe group (baseline CGI score of 6 or 7) was significantly higher than in the moderate group (baseline CGI score of 4 or 5; 86.7% versus 55.9%, p = 0.007). Conclusion: A significantly higher response rate was observed in the study cohort with serum aripiprazole concentrations over 300 ng/ml. Therefore, dosing higher than the current recommended range may potentially improve the treatment efficacy in the Chinese population. Because the serum concentration varies among patients due to multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors, TDM, especially in outpatients, is recommended if the clinical response is limited.</td>

      <td>Background: Polypharmacy in haemodialysis patients can not only manifest as the continued prescribing of unnecessary medications but also has the potential to increase medication-related hospital admissions, morbidity, and mortality. A validated deprescribing algorithm has recently been developed, specifically targeted at dialysis patients. This paper audits the experience of implementing this algorithm in Australian dialysis settings. Aim: The aim of this paper was to evaluate the usefulness and applicability of the pharmacist-led Toronto deprescribing tool in Australian haemodialysis settings. Method: The pharmacist-led deprescribing algorithm was implemented across two metropolitan sites and one rural site. The audit focused on five medications that could potentially be deprescribed in the target patient group (diuretics, alpha blockers, statins, proton pump inhibitors [PPIs], and quinine). Between 1 and 12 months later, a reaudit was conducted, with patients followed up to confirm if medications remained deprescribed. Results: Two hundred and eleven patients across three sites were reviewed. Application of the algorithm resulted in 168 medications deemed appropriate to deprescribe. Of these 168 medications, 56 (33%) were initially deprescribed, with 50 medications (30%) remaining deprescribed on reaudit. The deprescribing rates varied between the three different services, with initial deprescribing rates ranging from 18% to 61%. After follow-up, deprescribing changes across target medications were fairly static, with only a small number of patients restarting either their diuretic or PPI. Conclusion: The pharmacist-led deprescribing algorithm resulted in substantial deprescribing across the three sites. Deprescribing rates varied between the sites due to differences in the team model that the pharmacist worked within and the method of the rollout. Further studies should draw on aspects such as finding enablers to overcome prescriber and patient concerns about deprescribing and the aspects of which team models lead to higher rates of successful deprescribing.</td>

In Germany 54,500 patients become infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria per year, causing about 2400 attributable deaths. Rising resistance in Gram-negative bacteria especially carbapenem-resistant pathogens is of particular concern due to the lack of effective and safe alternative treatment options. Objective: The results from trials and compassionate-use programs with the new antibiotic cefiderocol, which was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in April 2020 for the treatment of adults with infections caused by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, are summarized. Results: The new β‑lactam antibiotic cefiderocol is the first siderophore cephalosporin indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options. Its chemical structure and its unique mechanism of action confer enhanced stability against β‑lactamases including all classes of clinically relevant carbapenemases. In vitro data show high antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacterales and nonfermenters, including carbapenem-resistant strains. In clinical trials, cefiderocol showed superiority in complicated urinary tract infection in comparison to imipenem and non-inferiority versus meropenem in hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated pneumonia patients and severe infections caused by carbapenem-resistant pathogens. Conclusion: Clinical trial data and case reports identified in the literature search show that cefiderocol is a promising treatment option for severe infections caused by drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, particularly carbapenem-resistant bacteria.</td>

      <td>Effect of quetiapine on inflammation and immunity: a systematic review</td>
      <td>Introduction: Knowledge about the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders is increasing in the last decades and evidence from literature suggests a central role for immuno-inflammatory mechanisms in these illnesses. The antipsychotic quetiapine acts on dopamine and serotonin signalling and well-established evidence demonstrates that these neurotransmitters can modulate immune functions in healthy and diseased conditions. Starting from this perspective, in the last few decades, a number of studies attempted to identify quetiapine effects on immune functions in order to highlight a possible additional effect of this drug in psychotic diseases, although no conclusive results were obtained. Methods: We critically reviewed preclinical and clinical studies evaluating quetiapine effects on immune systems, suggesting strategies for future work in this field. Results: Computerised search, in PubMed and Embase databases, was performed in March 2020: 120 studies were identified but only 29 relevant papers were selected for detailed review. Conclusion: Despite some interesting preliminary findings about anti-inflammatory effects of quetiapine, mainly supported by preclinical studies, it is possible to conclude further studies are needed to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of this drug and achieve a better understanding of its relevance on clinical outcomes to finally identify new therapeutic approaches in psychiatric treatment.Keypoints Mounting evidence points to a role for immuno-inflammatory mechanisms in psychiatric disorders. Quetiapine (QUE) acts on catecholamine (dopamine and norepinephrine) and serotonin signalling. The immunomodulatory effects of catecholamines are well established. Treatment with QUE in psychiatric disorders could leverage immunomodulatory effects. QUE unclear role in immune function modulation suggests future work.</td>

The purpose of this study is to prepare pulmonary powder formulations containing both colistin and tobramycin and to assess their in vitro aerosol performance and storage stability. Methods: The dry powder formulations were manufactured using a lab-scale spray dryer. In vitro aerosol performance was measured using a Next Generation Impactor. The storage stability of the dry powder formulations was measured at 22°C and two relative humidity levels – 20 and 55%. Colistin composition on the particle surface was measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results: Two combination formulations, with 1:1 and 1:5 molar ratios of colistin and tobramycin, showed fine particle fractions (FPF) of 85%, which was significantly higher than that of the spray dried tobramycin (45%). FPF of the tobramycin formulation increased significantly when stored for four weeks at both 20% and 55% RH. In contrast, FPF values of both combination formulations and spray dried colistin remained stable at both humidity levels. Particle surface of each combination was significantly enriched in colistin molecules; 1:5 combination showed 77% by wt. colistin. Conclusions: The superior aerosol performance and aerosolization stability of 1:1 and 1:5 combination formulations of colistin and tobramycin could be attributed to enrichment of colistin on the co-spray dried particle surface. The observed powder properties may be the result of a surfactant-like assembly of these colistin molecules during spray drying, thus forming a hydrophobic particle surface.</td>

This is why the charm II radio receptor technique for the detection of antimicrobial residues in aquaculture fish initiated in Belgium was transferred to Cameroon according to Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The validation parameters included the following tests: repeatability, reproducibility and robustness in addition to the mandatory characteristics, detection capability and specificity. Selected veterinary drug-free fish samples of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), catfish (Clarias gariepinus), carp (Cyprinus Carpio) and kanga (Heterotis niloticus) were spiked at different target concentrations with different antimicrobials (β-lactams, tetracycline, sulfonamides, macrolides and chloramphenicol). The detection capabilities (CCβ) were at MRPL (0.3 µg/kg for chloramphenicol), or below the regulatory limits in a range of 0.25–0.5 MRL with 0% false-negative results. β-lactams (penicillin G), tetracyclines (tetracycline, chloretetracycline and oxytetracycline) and macrolides (erythromycine A) were detected at half MRL (25, 50 and 100 µg/kg respectively), while sulfonamides (sulfamethazine) was detected at 25 µg/kg (0.25 MRL). The detection capabilities (CCβ) obtained were satisfactory as the cut-off factors (Fm) were less than the mean values of blank fish readings (B) (Fm &lt; B). Furthermore, the method was applicable since the cut-off factor was less than the positivity threshold (Fm &lt; T). The variability of the data under repeatability and reproducibility conditions was acceptable, with a relative standard deviation less than 15%. Results were unaffected by delaying the reading time from 0 h to 24 h after the addition of scintillation fluid, with a precision below 16%. Likewise, non-target drugs were not detected even at high concentrations (100 MRL) in a cross-reactivity study. From the overall results, the performance characteristics (detection capabilities, precision, robustness and specificity) were suitable and comparable to the initial validation results, indicating that the transfer to Cameroon laboratory was valid, the method was reliable and could be used in aquaculture fish quality monitoring programs in Cameroon.</td>

Mechanistically, K73-03 effectively inhibited the cell proliferation of PC cells, and induced apoptosis and autophagy of ASPC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, pretreatment with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, significantly inhibited K73-03-induced autophagy and enhanced K73-03-induced apoptotic cell death. K73-03 also strongly repressed ASPC-1 cells xenograft growth in vivo. Thus, all these findings provided new clues about OA analog K73-03 as an effective anticancer agent targeted EGFR against ASPC-1 cells, it is worth further evaluation in the future.</td>

      <td>Efficacy of anti-fungal agents for invasive fungal infection prophylaxis in liver transplant recipients: A network meta-analysis</td>
      <td>At present, there is still a lack of effective invasive fungal prophylaxis therapy in liver transplant recipients (LTRs). This study aimed to analysis the latest evidence on efficacy of current prophylactic anti-fungal therapy, and systematically compare between anti-fungal agents and placebo by a fixed-effects meta-analysis in all randomised controlled trials. A network meta-analysis was performed for invasive fungal infection (IFI) among different agents in 14 randomised controlled trials, in which 10 anti-fungal approaches were identified. Overall, anti-fungal prophylaxis reduced the rate of IFI (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.18–0.52) and proven IFI (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14–0.53) when compared to placebo. In the network meta-analysis, an equivalent reduction in the rate of IFI was observed in fluconazole (OR 4.70, 95% CI 1.22–18.10), itraconazole (OR 5.82, 95% CI 1.10–30.71) and Liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB, OR 5.74, 95% CI 1.29–25.58) groups when compared with placebo. Anidulafungin might be the most effective agents in IFI prevention; however, this superiority did not meet statistically significance. Our study indicated that fluconazole, echinocandins and LAmB are equivalent in efficacy. Of which, fluconazole is recommended for the prevention of IFI in LTRs due to its efficacy, economics and compliance.</td>

      <td>Doxycycline Suppresses Vasculogenic Mimicry in Human Pterygium Fibroblasts</td>
      <td>Purpose: To explore the effect of doxycycline on vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation and the potential mechanism in human pterygium fibroblasts in order to find novel targets for pterygium therapy. Methods: First, we demonstrate the existence of VM in 73 pterygium specimens by CD31 and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) dual staining. Then we used cell counting kit-8, clone formation assay and flow cytometry to prove the inhibitory effect of doxycycline on cell proliferation and apoptosis. The VM formation was evaluated through wound healing assay, cell transwell assay and three-dimensional cell culture combined with PAS staining. Finally, we used Western blot to testify the correlation of the VM and the factors in protein level preliminarily. Results: Our results showed that VM existed in human pterygium specimens exactly. Otherwise, in human pterygium fibroblasts, doxycycline induced a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis induction. Besides, doxycycline significantly suppressed vasculogenic mimicry tube formation, cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, doxycycline impaired the expression of MMP-9, MMP-2 and VEGF which may related to pterygium VM formation. Conclusions: Doxycycline decelerated pterygium progression might be through inhibiting VM formation according to the downregulation of MMP-9, MMP-2 and VEGF, which may provide the basis of further studies involving doxycycline for pterygium treatment.</td>

      <td>Introduction: Only a few reports are available on the population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of linezolid and its main metabolites. Therefore, we investigated the population PK of linezolid and its metabolites in adult patients treated with intravenous linezolid to identify the causative factors affecting pharmacokinetics, and evaluated the relationship between the parent compound and major metabolites PNU-142300 and PNU-142586. Methods: Population PK analysis was performed using medical data collected from patients who were treated with intravenous linezolid (600 mg twice daily). We examined the impact of covariate candidates such as demographic characteristics and laboratory parameters. Simulations using the final model were investigated and used to estimate the plasma concentrations, trough concentrations (C(min)), and area under the curve (AUC) of linezolid and its metabolites, and the metabolite-to-parent ratios for C(min) and AUC were used to assess the accumulation of metabolites over linezolid. Results: A total of 82 plasma concentrations from 23 patients were analyzed. The volume of distribution was estimated to be 47.1 L, assuming that linezolid and its metabolites were the same. The total clearance (CL) of linezolid, and CLs of PNU-142300 and PNU-142586 were influenced by creatinine clearance (CLcr), with population mean CLs of 3.86, 7.27, and 13.54 L/h, respectively. The C(min) and AUCs of linezolid and its metabolites and the ratios of metabolites per linezolid were predicted to increase exponentially with decreasing renal function. Conclusion: We developed the first population PK model in which CLcr was incorporated as a covariate in the CL of linezolid and its metabolites. Using the final model, it was possible to predict the plasma concentration, C(min), and AUC appropriately. The model was found to be a potentially useful tool for future studies on optimal dosing and toxicity analysis.</td>

      <td>Intravenous route for folate supplementation in a patient with celiac disease treated by pemetrexed-based chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer</td>
      <td>Introduction: Oral folic acid supplementation is essential for patients treated with pemetrexed, to prevent the risk of severe hematologic toxicity. In case of intestinal absorption disorder, no recommendations exist for intravenous folic acid supplementation. Case report: We describe a 74-year-old patient with multimetastatic non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma, receiving first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC5, pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. The patient presented neglected celiac disease, resulting in malabsorption syndrome with iron and folic acid deficiency. The question was how to administer folic acid supplementation during the pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. Management and outcomes: Intravenous injection of 200 mg levoleucovorin on day 1 of cycle 1 of pemetrexed-based chemotherapy was administered and well tolerated. During the second cycle, the levoleucovorin perfusion was not renewed by omission. The patient was hospitalized for 7 days because of febrile aplasia. Piperacillin–tazobactam was started, and then switched to amoxicillin–clavulanate plus ciprofloxacin. After this episode of post-chemotherapy febrile aplasia, it was decided to systematically supplement the patient with intravenous levoleucovorin, with blood folate concentration monitoring at each cycle. At 16 months after start of treatment, the patient was in complete remission, indicating that the immune-chemotherapy was effective, with no further febrile neutropenia. Discussion/conclusion: This case report highlights intravenous levoleucovorin supplementation as an alternative to oral folic acid if needed during pemetrexed–antifolate-based chemotherapy.</td>

      <td>Evaluation of Safety and Clinically Relevant Drug–Drug Interactions with Tucatinib in Healthy Volunteer﻿s</td>
      <td>Background and Objective: Tucatinib is approved for treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Understanding potential drug–drug interactions (DDIs) informs proper dosing when co-administering tucatinib with other therapies. The aim of this study was to evaluate DDIs between tucatinib and metabolizing enzymes and transporters in healthy volunteers. Methods: Parts A–C assessed the impact of itraconazole (cytochrome P450 [CYP] 3A4 inhibitor), rifampin (CYP3A4/CYP2C8 inducer), or gemfibrozil (CYP2C8 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of a single 300 mg dose of tucatinib ﻿administered orally and its primary metabolite, ONT-993. Parts D and E assessed the effect of steady-state tucatinib on the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide (CYP2C8 substrate), tolbutamide (CYP2C9 substrate), midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), and digoxin (P-glycoprotein substrate). Results: Tucatinib area under the concentration–time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0–inf)) increased by ~ 1.3- and 3.0-fold with itraconazole and gemfibrozil, respectively, and decreased by 48% with rifampin, indicating that tucatinib is metabolized primarily by CYP2C8, and to a lesser extent via CYP3A. Tucatinib was a strong inhibitor of CYP3A (midazolam AUC(0–inf) increased 5.7-fold)﻿, a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 and P-glycoprotein, and had no impact on CYP2C9-mediated metabolism in humans. Tucatinib was well tolerated, alone and with co-administered drugs. Conclusion: The potential DDIs identified here may be mitigated by avoiding concomitant use of tucatinib with strong CYP3A inducers, moderate CYP2C8 inducers, CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (modifying substrate dose where concomitant use is unavoidable), and strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (decreasing tucatinib dose where concomitant use is unavoidable), or by reducing the dose of P-glycoprotein substrates with a narrow therapeutic window.

      <td>Background: Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) are presumed to be associated with retinal thinning. However, evidence is lacking as to whether these retinal alterations reflect a disease-specific process or are rather a consequence of comorbid diseases or concomitant microvascular impairment. Methods: The study included 126 eyes of 65 patients with SSDs and 143 eyes of 72 healthy controls. We examined macula and optic disc measures by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCT-A). Additive mixed models were used to assess the impact of SSDs on retinal thickness and perfusion and to explore the association of retinal and clinical disease-related parameters by controlling for several ocular and systemic covariates (age, sex, spherical equivalent, intraocular pressure, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, smoking status, and OCT signal strength). Results: OCT revealed significantly lower parafoveal macular, macular ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), and macular retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and thinner mean and superior peripapillary RNFL in SSDs. In contrast, the applied OCT-A investigations, which included macular and peripapillary perfusion density, macular vessel density, and size of the foveal avascular zone, did not reveal any significant between-group differences. Finally, a longer duration of illness and higher chlorpromazine equivalent doses were associated with lower parafoveal macular and macular RNFL thickness. Conclusions: This study strengthens the evidence for disease-related retinal thinning in SSDs.</td>

Data Sources: A literature search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed to identify manuscripts published between December 1962 and June 2022. Search terms included CQ, HCQ, psychiatry, psychosis, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, delirium, and psychotic disorders. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Relevant studies included reports of adverse effects after CQ or HCQ ingestion. Data Synthesis: The current literature presents evidence for a risk of short-term psychiatric adverse effects induced by either CQ or HCQ. However, the populational-level studies presented some limitations regarding the voluntary response in survey data, self-report adverse effects, and placebo group reporting similar symptoms to the case group. Thus, populational-level studies addressing the discussed limitations and the nature and extent of possible psychiatric adverse effects are needed. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Most of the patients who developed such adverse effects did not report a family history of psychiatric disease. The frequency of psychiatric adverse effects depends on the patient’s biological sex, age, and body mass index, but not on the drug dosage. Conclusions: Based on clinical trials and case reports, the current literature presents evidence for a risk of short-term psychiatric adverse effects induced by either drug.</td>

We reviewed the cases of 7 patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis with a positive cerebrospinal fluid culture among 1147 patients who underwent cord blood transplantation (CBT) at our institution between September 2007 and September 2020. The diagnosis was made on day + 5– + 45, and 5 patients developed bacterial meningitis before neutrophil engraftment.

Six patients developed bacterial meningitis secondary to prior or concomitant bacteremia caused by the same bacterium. Five patients had received anti-MRSA agents at onset: vancomycin in 3, teicoplanin in 1, and daptomycin in 1. After diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, linezolid was eventually used for 6 patients. Two patients with E. gallinarum were alive at day + 1380 and + 157 after CBT, respectively, whereas 5 patients died 17–53 (median 43) days after the onset of bacterial meningitis. Breakthrough meningitis in CBT can occur even during the use of anti-MRSA drugs, and intensive antibiotic treatment is necessary.</td>

      <td>Opioids or benzodiazepines use is known to increase the risk of delirium. The prevalence of delirium is high in pediatric cardiac intensive care units (CICUs) with associated morbidity and mortality. We investigate the short-term effects of quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic medication, on opioid and benzodiazepine requirements, and any associated adverse events as we utilize quetiapine to treat delirium symptoms in this single-center, retrospective study. Twenty-eight patients who received quetiapine between January 2018 and June 2019 in the CICU met inclusion criteria for the analysis. The quetiapine initiation dose was 0.5 mg/kg/dose every 8 h and we allowed 48 h for quetiapine to reach a steady state. Overall opioid and benzodiazepine requirements were compared 72 h before and 72 h after the quetiapine steady state. There was a statistically significant reduction in the total daily opioid (p = 0.001) and benzodiazepine (p = 0.01) amounts following quetiapine initiation. There was also a statistically significant decrease in the total number of daily PRNs requirement for both opioids (p &lt; 0.001) and benzodiazepines (p = 0.03). Nine out of 13 patients were completely weaned off continuous opioid drips following quetiapine initiation (p = 0.01). The presence of steady-state habituation medications, including methadone or lorazepam, did not have any statistically significant effect on weaning continuous opioid (p = 0.18) or benzodiazepine (p = 0.62) drips. There was no statistically significant effect of quetiapine on the QTc interval after quetiapine initiation (p = 0.58) with no clinically significant arrhythmias observed during the study period. Our study demonstrates a statistically significant reduction in opioid and benzodiazepine requirements following quetiapine initiation to treat delirium symptoms without significant adverse effects in patients with congenital heart disease in the short term.</td>

      <td>Purpose: In Gonadotropin releasing hormone(GnRH) agonist IVF, after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin(HCG) triggering, there is a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome(OHSS). Few methods exist to prevent OHSS in these cases. Therefore, we investigated the use of a GnRH antagonist to decrease the risk of OHSS, due to its ability to decrease VEGF production and function. Method: A retrospective cohort study of 171-IVF patients at risk for developing OHSS after a GnRH agonist cycle with HCG trigger was performed from 2011 to 2019. The patient population consisted of women with an unexpected exuberant response to stimulation based on ovarian reserve testing and were triggered with hCG. Women were converted to a freeze-all cycle and received either cabergoline 0.5 mg orally alone for 7 days from the collection(Group 1, n = 123) or received cabergoline 0.5 mg orally and ganirelix, 250 mcg SC for 7–10 days(Group 2, n = 48). Results: Group 1 had more cases of moderate and severe OHSS than group 2-(25% vs. 10% p = 0.03, and 52% vs. 25% p = 0.001 respectively). Group 1 reported more abdominal discomfort and bloating than group 2(91% vs. 65% p &lt; 0.001) and the presence of free fluid was more frequent in group 1 than group 2(74% vs. 35% p &lt; 0.001). Hemoconcentration and electrolyte disturbances were less severe in group 2 than in group 1 (p &lt; 0.001 all cases). Conclusion: In patients at high risk for developing OHSS after hCG trigger in a GnRH agonist cycle, the addition of GnRH antagonists in the luteal phase may reduce the risk of developing moderate and severe OHSS. The GnRH antagonist likely leads to more rapid luteolysis and down regulation of VEGF production and receptor response, thereby decreasing the hallmark increased vascular permeability.</td>

      <td>Background: Resistance of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) to antibiotics is an evolving and dynamic process. Presence of antibiotic resistance impacts the success rate of initial eradication strategies in the clinic. Aim: To improve the success rate of initial eradication therapy and explore new antibiotic regimens, a large sample-based study utilizing antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed. A total of 2508 H. pylori strains from patients subjected to initial eradication therapy were isolated, cultured, and tested for drug susceptibility from 2017 to 2021. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was recorded. H. pylori susceptibility profiles and its change trends from initial eradication patients were analyzed. The relationships between drug resistance, year of sample collection, age, and sex of patients were analyzed. Results: The overall resistance rates were as follows: amoxicillin (9.25%), clarithromycin (38.48%), levofloxacin (42.86%), furazolidone (11.28%), doxycycline (8.56%), rifampicin (10.81%), tinidazole (74.32%), gatifloxacin (61.71%), tetracycline (0%), metronidazole (78.71%), ornidazole (97.87%), and fosfomycin (31.67%). Only 38.04% of the strains were pansusceptible to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and furazolidone, followed by those of mono resistance (29.90%), double resistance (24.96%), triple resistance (6.34%), and quadruple resistance (0.76%). Significant differences in the resistance rate and MIC were also observed in different age and sex groups. Time of collection and patient age and sex were associated with the distribution of antibiotic resistance. Conclusion: With the increasing resistance rate and multiple resistance of H. pylori to commonly used antibiotics, drug susceptibility testing is imperative to permit individualized therapy, and a regimen containing the combination of amoxicillin, furazolidone, tetracycline, doxycycline, or rifampicin is reasonable for initial empirical eradication therapy.</td>

      <td>Arsenic is a naturally occurring metalloid that exists in water, soil, food, and air. Humans can be exposed to arsenic through occupational, medical, or nutritional routes. Both acute and chronic forms of toxicity with severe outcomes are likely following arsenic exposure. Neurotoxicity is one of the serious manifestations of arsenic toxicity. In our study, the effect of minocycline, a widely used antimicrobial agent with antioxidant aspects and the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, was evaluated against arsenic-induced neurotoxicity. PC12 cell line was used as the cellular model of this study. Cells were pre-treated with minocycline (50 nM–1 µM) for 2 h, and then incubated for 24 h after adding sodium arsenite (10 µM). The MTT assay and fluorimetry were performed to study cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species generation, respectively. Finally, Western blotting was done to determine the levels of caspase-8, Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3. Once exposed to arsenic, the cell viability was significantly reduced, the intracellular oxidative balance was significantly disrupted, and the levels of proteins caspase-8, Bax/Bcl-2, and caspase-3 were significantly increased. Minocycline not only attenuated arsenic-induced cytotoxicity and reduced oxidative stress, but also led to lower levels of caspase-8, Bax/Bcl-2, and caspase-3 proteins compared with the arsenic-treated cells. Minocycline can significantly protect cells against arsenic-induced neurotoxicity by antioxidant and anti-apoptosis properties via both intrinsic and extrinsic caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways; therefore, at this point, it’s worth considering it as a promising agent for the treatment of arsenic toxicity.</td>

Presenting clinical syndromes included agitation in 60 (35.3%) subjects, anxiety in 37 (21.7%), psychosis in 27 (15.8%), chest pain in 26 (15.3%) and altered level of consciousness in 20 (11.7%). SI was observed in 48 (28.2%) individuals, 12 (7.1%) required admission to the intensive care unit, and two (1.2%) died. Altered level of consciousness (odds ratio [OR] 6.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2–18.9; p &lt; 0.01), psychosis (OR 5.8; 95% CI 2.2–15.1; p &lt; 0.01) and suicide attempt (OR 4.6; 95% CI 1.8–11.6; p 0.01) were associated with SI in the adjusted analysis. Conclusions: Amphetamine-related intoxication causes high morbidity in people living with HIV. Healthcare providers serving these patients should consider incorporating harm-reduction measures in the prevention of amphetamine-related intoxication.</td>

      <td>Inducible motor neuron differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells in vivo</td>
      <td>Objectives: Transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is one of the promising treatment strategies for motor neuron diseases (MNDs). However, the inefficiency in committed differentiation of NPCs in vivo limits its application. Here, we tried to establish a potential therapeutic strategy for MNDs by in vivo directional differentiation of hiPSCs engineered with motor neuron (MN) specific transcription factors and Tet-On system. Materials and Methods: We engineered hiPSCs with three MN-specific transcription factors and Tet-On system. The engineered cells were directly transplanted into immunodeficient mice through subcutaneous, intra-spinal cord and intracerebroventricular injections. Following doxycycline (Dox) induction, teratoma formation, and motor MN differentiation were evaluated. Results: We generated genetically engineered hiPSCs, in which the expression of Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 was controlled by a drug-inducible transgenic system. These cells showed normal pluripotency and proliferative capacity, and were able to directionally differentiate into mature motor neurons (MNs) and NPCs with high efficiency in spinal cords and cerebral lateral ventricles under the induction of Dox. The grafts showed long-term survival in the recipient mice without formation of teratoma. Conclusions: The induced mature MNs and NPCs were expected to replace the damaged endogenous MNs directly, and play a role of de novo stem cell stock for long-term neuron damage repair, respectively. Therefore, in vivo directional differentiation of the hiPSCs engineered with MN-specific transcription factors and Tet-On system via Dox induction could be a potential therapeutic strategy for MNDs with high efficacy and safety.</td>

      <td>Real-life benefits of intrajejunal levodopa infusion therapy in four patients with the parkinsonian variant of progressive supranuclear palsy: A 1-year follow-up data report</td>
      <td>Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition presenting with different clinical endophenotypes. The parkinsonian variant of PSP (PSP-P) is characterised by early but fading responsiveness to high-dose levodopa therapy; however, high-dose oral therapy is often associated with intolerance due to dopaminergic side effects and so doses may have to be capped despite clinical benefits. Evidence from animal models and real-life registries suggest far higher doses of levodopa can be tolerated if given in a continuous drug delivery (CDD) manner. We investigated tolerance and possible clinical benefits in patients with PSP-P still responsive to levodopa after initiating CDD in the form of intrajejunal levodopa infusion (IJLI) therapy as part of a compassionate usage program (CU). Methods: This is an observational clinical data report from the IJLI implementation program undertaken in regional tertiary referral Parkinson's centres in India and at King's College Hospital London, Dubai as part of a CU. Four patients with PSP-P receiving IJLI as a part of a CU underwent evaluations of liver and renal function, motor and nonmotor function, quality of life, sleep dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety and depression, and cognitive impairment at baseline and 6 and 12 months post-IJLI initiation. Results: In total, three out of four patients successfully completed 12 months of treatment (6 months in one patient). All four patients showed good tolerability to IJLI even at higher doses (1400 and 1960 mg at 6 and 12 months, respectively) when compared to oral levodopa (812.5 ± 103 levodopa equivalent daily dose [LEDD]) and presented with overall persistent improvements in motor and nonmotor scores and quality-of-life scores at 6 and 12 months post-IJLI. All patients showed improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate (43.50 ml/min/1.73 m(2) to 67.5 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 79.5 ml/min/1.73 m(2) at 6 and 12 months, respectively). Conclusions: IJLI led to persistent beneficial effects on motor and some nonmotor aspects in patients with PSP-P at up to 12 months after treatment with associated improvement in overall renal function.</td>

      <td>SARS-CoV-2 infection can present in different clinical forms, most commonly as bilateral pneumonia, but also with pericardial/myocardial involvement. Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 is associated with worse outcomes. The authors report a case of myopericarditis as the primary manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 20-year-old male patient with no known cardiovascular (CV) disorders or risk factors. The patient presented with pleuritic chest pain and high fever, with no respiratory symptoms. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram changes were consistent with pericarditis; concomitant elevation of cardiac enzymes revealed myocardial involvement. The patient had a slow but favourable evolution with no apparent impact on cardiac function. Other causes of myopericarditis were excluded and SARS-CoV-2 admitted as the most likely aetiological agent. This case highlights possible cardiac involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection with little or no pulmonary disease in a young healthy patient.

      <td>Tumor microenvironment (TME) is the ecosystem surrounding a tumor to influence tumor cells’ growth, metastasis and immunological battlefield, in which the tumor systems fight against the body system. TME has been considered as the essential link between the tumorigenesis and development of neoplasm. Both nutrients intake and tumor progression to malignancy require the participation of components in TME. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step in the metastasis of tumor cells. Cells that lost polarity and acquired migration ability are prone to metastasize. Autophagy is an important self-protective mechanism in tumor cells and a necessity for the tumor cells to respond to harmful stress. Protective autophagy benefits tumor cells while abnormal autophagy leads to cell injury or death. EMT and autophagy are directly regulated by TME. To date, there are numerous studies on TME, autophagy and EMT separately, but few on their complex interrelationships. This review aims to comprehensively analyze the existing mechanisms and convincing evidence so far to seek novel therapeutic strategies and research directions.</td>

      <td>Acinetobacter spp. is emerging as an important human and veterinary pathogen, mostly due to intrinsic and acquired resistance to antimicrobials. Despite its public health relevance, little is known about the prevalence, role of different Acinetobacter species and antimicrobial resistance profile of animal-origin isolates. Traditional phenotypic tests may fail to discriminate Acinetobacter species, therefore molecular analyses are often required as a complementary approach. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the occurrence of strains of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii (Acb) complex isolated from animal infections including urinary tract infections, otitis, piodermitis and pododermatitis, and its resistance profile against different antimicrobial classes, including carbapenems. All Gram-negative coccobacilli isolates were characterized by MALDI-TOF and multiplex PCR, and the disk diffusion test was used to investigate multi-drug resistance (MDR) and carbapenem resistance genes by PCR as preconized by the standard guidelines. MALDI-TOF technique identified 21 strains belonging to the Acb complex (10 A. pittii, 8 A. baumannii, 3 A. nosocomialis, 1 A. ursingii, and 1 A. venetianus). Multiplex PCR confirmed the results of MALDI-TOF for 20 strains. Eight strains (34.78%) were classified as MDR, being 50% (4/8) A. baumannii, 37.5% (3/8) A. pittii, and 12.5% (1/8) A. nosocomialis. None of the isolates presented phenotypic carbapenemase production. Considering the carbapenem resistance genes, 26.09% (6/23) of the isolates presented one or more carbapenemase genes. From these, 50% (3/6) presented only bla(VIM), 33.33% (2/6) presented only bla(IMP), and 16.67% (1/6) presented bla(IMP) e bla(VIM,) simultaneously. These genes were detected among A. pittii isolates mostly (66.67%, 4/6). This study provides further insights into the occurrence and resistance profile of Acinetobacter of animal origin.</td>

      <td>Background: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare hyperinflammatory condition with a wide range of causes, being frequently associated with infections in adults. The association between HLH and acute HIV infection has been rarely described. Case presentation: A 62-year-old male, with a past medical history of Henoch-Schönlein purpura under immunosuppressive treatment, presented with a two-week history of fever, asthenia, anorexia, cough and purpuric rash. Initial blood tests showed pancytopenia, elevated C-reactive protein and renal failure. Microbiological investigations were negative, but persistent fever and pancytopenia led to HLH suspicion. This diagnosis was supported by hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, high soluble-interleukin-2 receptor levels and hepatosplenomegaly, fulfilling 5/8 diagnostic criteria of the Histiocyte Society-2004. Further investigation revealed a positive HIV-1 antibody and the patient reported recent sexual risks, with TCD4 + lymphocytes below 100/mL and HIV-1 viremia above 10 million copies/mL, confirming an acute HIV infection. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) and glucocorticoids were started with full clinical recovery. Conclusion: HLH occurrence can be obscured by the features of a primary disease and can mimic other clinic conditions. In this patient, the prompt identification of an acute HIV infection as the cause of HLH allowed the early initiation of antiretroviral treatment and corticosteroids, with an efficient control of the viral replication and inflammatory response, preventing a potentially fatal evolution.</td>

As an opportunistic infection, bone cryptococcosis usually occurs in patients with immunodeficiency diseases or in those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy and often displays characteristics of disseminated disease. Isolated cryptococcal osteomyelitis is extremely unusual in immunocompetent person. The pathogenic fungus often invades vertebrae, femur, tibia, rib, clavicle, pelvis, and humerus, but the ulna is a rare target. CASE SUMMARY A 79-year-old woman complaining of chronic pain, skin ulceration and a sinus on her right forearm was admitted, and soon after was diagnosed with cryptococcal osteomyelitis in the right ulna. Unexpectedly, she was also found to have apparently normal immunity. After treatment with antifungal therapy combined with surgery debridement, the patient’s osteomyelitis healed with a satisfactory outcome. CONCLUSION Although rare, cryptococcal osteomyelitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of osteolytic lesions even in immunocompetent patients, and good outcomes can be expected if early definitive diagnosis and etiological treatment are established.</td>

More than one-third of SLE patients present ocular manifestations. Choroidal disease is currently not completely understood, and its precise differentiation from central serous chorioretinopathy is rarely achieved. To date, no more than 60 patients with choroidal involvement have been reported. CASE SUMMARY A 37-year-old Chinese woman experienced decreased visual acuity bilaterally, accompanied by increasing periorbital swelling and severe conjunctival chemosis. Decreased breath sounds in both bases were detected via auscultation, as well as pitting edema in both ankles. SLE and lupus nephritis were diagnosed based on serositis, renal disorder, leukopenia and positive anti-Smith and anti-nuclear antibodies. Lupus choroidopathy was diagnosed based on ocular presentation and imaging. The patient was treated with systemic corticosteroids, spironolactone, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and intravenous immunoglobulin. After 4 wk of hospitalization, the patient was discharged. Indocyanine green angiography showed no leakage from choroidal vessels, and ocular coherence tomography detected low amounts of subretinal fluid right before discharge. The patient was prescribed oral methylprednisolone, HCQ, and MMF. Two months after the first visit, ophthalmological examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/20 bilaterally, and SLE disease activity was well controlled; her symptoms disappeared completely. CONCLUSION Here we presented a case of lupus choroidopathy, successfully treated with systemic corticosteroids, and discussed previously reported cases, focusing on differential diagnosis with a central serous chorioretinopathy.</td>

In addition to systemic side effects, several usually mild ocular adverse effects have been reported. We report a case of rarely reported vision-threatening bilateral panuveitis with serous retinal detachment, thickened choroid, and chorioretinal folds associated with dabrafenib and trametinib targeted therapy for B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutant metastatic cutaneous melanoma. CASE SUMMARY A 59-year-old female patient with metastatic melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib presented with blurry vision and central scotoma lasting for 3 d in both eyes. Clinical examination and multimodal imaging revealed inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber, mild vitritis, bullous multiple serous retinal detachments, and chorioretinal folds in both eyes. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was suspended, and the patient was treated with topical and intravenous corticosteroids followed by oral corticosteroid treatment with a tapering schedule. One and a half months after the disease onset, ocular morphological and functional improvement was noted. Due to the metastatic melanoma dissemination, BRAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors were reintroduced and some mild ocular adverse effects reappeared CONCLUSION Patients on combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib may rarely develop severe bilateral panuveitis with a good prognosis. Further studies have to establish potential usefulness of ophthalmological examination for asymptomatic patients. Furthermore, appropriate guidelines for managing panuveitis associated with dabrafenib and trametinib should be established.</td>

      <td>The Role of Methyl-(Z)-11-tetradecenoate Acid from the Bacterial Membrane Lipid Composition in Escherichia coli Antibiotic Resistance</td>
      <td>Background. The bacterial membrane plays a critical role in the survival of bacteria and the effectiveness of antimicrobial peptides in protecting the host. The lipid constituents of the bacterial membrane are not evenly distributed, and they could be affected by clustering anionic lipids with cationic peptides with multiple positive charges. That could be harmful to bacteria because it prevents lipids from interacting with other molecular components of the cell membrane, disrupts existing natural domains, or creates phase boundary defects between the clustered lipids and the bulk of the membrane. This preliminary quantitative study is aimed at assembling a correlation between antibiotic resistance and bacterial lipid composition in E. coli, based on the function and arrangement of the bilipid coating of the bacterial cell, intimately associated with the path of antimicrobials through membranes. Methods. Fifteen multiresistant E. coli samples are collected from swine with enterocolitis tested for resistance levels using the disc diffusimetric method (Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion). Pathogen identification completed using the API 20E multitest system revealed the E. coli presence in 11 samples. In these samples, bacterial membrane detection of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) operating a 240 MS Ion Trap (Varian) GC/MS (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was performed, using the MIDI Sherlock recognition software model. Results. Interpreting the descriptive statistical method, the correlation matrix, and regression curves and after ANOVA analysis, we ascertained that the studied E. coli population statistically confirmed different degrees of resistance in most of the samples analyzed in this test. Conclusions. In one case, the methyl-(Z)-11-tetradecenoate acid was observed to have a relationship with the susceptibility evaluation by using the disc diffusimetric method, which has revealed the lowest rate of antimicrobial resistance, so it has importance in further resistance evaluation studies.</td>

      <td>Assessment of Milk Contamination, Associated Risk Factors, and Drug Sensitivity Patterns among Isolated Bacteria from Raw Milk of Borena Zone, Ethiopia</td>
      <td>Background. The contamination of raw milk depends on the number and type of organisms that can cause health risks, which can be judged by the presence of microorganisms and bacterial pathogens. This study evaluated bacterial contamination, the risk factor, and drug sensitivity patterns. Methods. A cross-sectional study was carried out on conveniently selected 95 milk producers. Data were collected using the structured pretest questionnaire and the observation control list. Subsequently, 15 to 20 ml of milk samples were taken for laboratory analysis. The milk samples have been diluted and continuously inoculated on the number of standard plates and the blue Eosin methylene germs for the total number of bacteria and coliforms counted. Biochemical and drug sensitivity tests have been done. The version 21 Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used for analysis. Analysis of the associated factors using binary logistical regression analysis and a P value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results. The total bacteria (TBC) and coliform count (CC) average with the standard deviation were 7.57 ± 0.83 log10 and 6.54 ± 1.53 log10 CFU/mL, respectively. The prevalence of raw milk contaminated with TBC and TCC was 84 (88.4%) and 75 (78.9%), respectively. Lack of handwash practice before milking (AOR = 2.4 [95% CI: 0.35-16.4]) and using unclean milk containers (AOR = 7.47 [95% CI: 0.0023-28.64]) were found to be significantly associated with bacterial contamination of raw milk. The bacteria isolated were E. coli (30.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.7%), and Salmonella spp. (1.2%). Among isolated bacteria, 76.3% were extensive drug resistant, 13.2% were multidrug resistant, and 2.6% were resistant to all drugs tested in the current study. Conclusion. Guaranteed appropriate hygiene exercise during time of milking and clean containers reduced milk contamination. Doctors should consider resistance to drugs during the treatment of patients with milk disease.</td>

Breathing disease swelling of the lung tubes caused by viral infection is more and more likely to develop into related to the lung tubes breathing disease, especially repeating breathing loudly. Objective. To investigate the effect of modified Sang ju-Yin Decoction combined with Interferon (IFN)αlb nebulization on children with asthmatic bronchitis and the effects of IL-1β and β-defensin 2 (HBD2). Materials and Methods. The clinical data of 80 children with asthmatic bronchitis who were diagnosed and treated in our hospital from May 2019 to May 2021 were selected as the research objects and divided into the control group and the observation group with 40 cases in each group according to different treatment methods. Among them, the control group was nebulized with IFNαlb, and the observation group was given addition and subtraction of Sang ju-Yin Decoction based on the control group. The clinical symptoms, pulmonary function indexes, adverse reactions, and effects on serum inflammatory indexes were observed and compared between the two groups. Results. There was no significant difference in the scores of symptoms and signs between the two groups before treatment (P&gt;0.05), while the scores of shortness of breath, cough, stridor, lung rales, and signs after treatment of observation group were better than those of the control group (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in serum inflammatory indexes and pulmonary function indexes between the two groups before treatment (P&gt;0.05), while the differences in IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-1β, and HBD2 after treatment were significant between the two groups (P&lt;0.05). After treatment, the RR, TV, and PEF indexes of the two groups of children were significantly improved (P&lt;0.05). After treatment, the adverse reaction rate of liver function damage, dry throat discomfort, rash, nausea, and vomiting in the observation group was 7.5%, which was significantly lower than 27.5% in the control group (P&lt;0.05).

      <td>Combination of the NRF2 Inhibitor and Autophagy Inhibitor Significantly Inhibited Tumorigenicity of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</td>
      <td>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent cancer in men. Developing new treatment methods for CRPC will be a significant challenge in the clinical treatment of PCa. In conclusion, the results of this study show that NRF2 is downregulated in untreated PCa samples compared to normal PCa samples; however, it was upregulated in mCRPC samples compared to HSPC samples. These results demonstrated that NRF2 may serve as a tumor suppressor in tumorigenesis but promote PCa androgen-independent transferring after ADT treatment. Bioinformatics analysis showed that NRF2 was related to multiple signaling, such as the AGE-RAGE pathway, MAPK pathway, NF-kappa B signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and VEGF signaling pathway. Moreover, we revealed that the NRF2 inhibitor significantly inhibited tumorigenicity of CRPC cells in vitro. Of note, combination of the NRF2 inhibitor and autophagy inhibitor had a more significantly suppressive role than either ML385 or CQ, indicating that combination of CQ (autophagy inhibitor) and ML385 (NRF2 inhibitor) is a potential treatment of CRPC. Finally, we conformed that high levels of autophagy regulators LC3B, ULK1, and beclin1 significantly correlated to longer PSA recurrence-free survival time. We think that this study could provide more evidence to confirm that NRF2 is a crucial regulator and targeting NRF2 and autophagy is a potential therapy option for CRPC.</td>

      <td>Use of antibiotics without following standard guidelines is routine practice in developing countries which is giving rise to genetic divergence and increased drug resistance. The current study analyzed genetic divergence and drug resistance by S. aureus and therapeutic efficacy of novel antibiotic combinations. The study revealed that 42.30% (minimum 20%-maximum 70%) of milk samples are positive for S. aureus. Study also revealed seven SNPs in the S. aureus nuc gene (c.53A&gt;G, c.61A&gt;G, c.73T&gt;C, c.93C&gt;A, c.217C&gt;T, c.280T&gt;C, and c.331T&gt;A). Local isolates Staph-2 and Staph-3 were closely related to Bos taurus nuc gene (bovine S. aureus), while Staph-1 was closely related to Homo sapiens (human S. aureus) indicating shifting of host. Change of two amino acids and staphylococcal nuclease conserved domain was observed in all local isolates of S. aureus. The isoelectric points predicted by protParam of Staph-1, Staph-2, and Staph-3 proteins were 9.30, 9.20, and 9.20, respectively. The antibiotic susceptibility profile of S. aureus presented highest resistance against penicillin (46.67%) and glycopeptide (43.33%). When a single antibiotic regimen was adopted in a field trial, the highest efficacy was reported in the case of oxytetracycline (80%) while lowest was presented by azithromycin. Among antibiotics' combined regimen, the highest efficacy (80%) was presented by gentamicin with oxytetracycline: cefotaxime with vancomycin; and ciprofloxacin with vancomycin. The current study concluded rising percentages of S. aureus from dairy milk, proofs of genetic host shifts, and altered responses of in on field therapeutics.</td>

      <td>Among drug-induced liver injuries (DILI), the cholestatic type is second in frequency (from 20 to 40%), the most common is the hepatocellular variant (up to 78%). For this reason, practitioners of various specialties, including neurologists and psychiatrists, do not monitor cholestasis parameters, and drug-induced liver injury with cholestasis (DILIС) remains unrecognized. The urgency of this problem is great, because the frequency of deaths in DILIС is only slightly lower than t in the hepatocellular type; in addition, it DILIС is much more likely to become persistent increasing the risk of chronic liver injury. Among the drugs used in neurology and psychiatry, the “leaders” in terms of the number of DILIС are antidepressants, both tricyclic (amitriptyline, imipramine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs: paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram), antidepressants), antipsychotics (chlorpromazine, fluphenazine), anticonvulsants (mainly carbamazepine). If the patient has a history of DILI caused by any of the forementioned medications, the agent should be switched to another drug from the same group with a minimal risk of DILI. If there is a history of DILI associated with antidepressants, it is recommended to choose SSRIs. It is necessary to monitor not only the activity of transaminases and bilirubin, but also the cholestasis parameters (alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase) during treatment.</td>

      <td>Xanthogranulomatous inflammation is an uncommon, nonneoplastic, chronic process in which the affected organ is destroyed by massive cellular infiltration of foamy histiocytes admixed with multinucleated giant cells, plasma cells, fibroblasts, neutrophils, and foci of necrosis. The organs most commonly affected by this entity are kidney and gallbladder. Only a few cases involving the ovary have been reported. The etiology of this entity is unknown, but the associated risk factors are infection, inappropriate antibiotic therapy, use of intrauterine contraceptive device, abnormalities in lipid metabolism, endometriosis, leiomyoma, and recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease. The current case was a 31-year-old female with post-in vitro fertilization (post-IVF) twin pregnancy, who presented with pain in the abdomen, provisionally diagnosed as ovarian mass with suspicion of malignancy. Patient was treated with antibiotics and an elective lower segment cesarean section was planned, due to lower abdominal pain and the presentation of both fetuses being breech. Patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with right oophorectomy and left double-J stenting, in view of left hydronephrosis. Diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous oophoritis was established on histopathological examination. There is only a single case; previously documented from India, in the setting of primary infertility. The present case report stresses that the condition may affect women of any age group and may be encountered in pregnancy, as has been observed in this case. Hence, thinking about this differential diagnosis in the cases presenting with similar complaints, would be of great value to avoid misdiagnosing them.</td>

It is usually associated with impaired quality of life (QoL) which can potentially progress to a stage in which the patient is physically and psychologically distressed and also, the global burden of the disease conditions attributable to neuropathic pain are increasing over the past decade for reasons unknown. This study was conducted to determine the prescribing pattern for neuropathic pain and to assess the improvement and tolerability of the prescribed medications in neuropathic pain.100 consecutive subjects of either gender aged 18-65 years with newly diagnosed neuropathic pain, who attended Pain Super Specialty Outpatient Department at KIMS Hospital and Research Centre, Bangalore were assessed for the pattern of drugs prescribed and improvement of pain and overall health was estimated by using Short-Form McGILL Pain Questionnaire. The mean age group of study subjects was 44.68 years, majority of which, were between 31-50 years with more preponderance among male subjects. The response to combination therapy with 1st line drugs were better when compared to monotherapy in effectively managing all the dimensions of pain. The response to NP was higher in subjects with younger age group, good socio-economic status, familial support, good awareness and functional status, regular follow-up visits.

      <td>Background. Effective and successful treatment of infectious diseases is a significant gain in clinical settings. However, resistance to antibiotics, especially the last-resort medicines, including carbapenems and colistin is on the rise. Aim. The aim of this study was to detect carbapenemase production and colistin-resistant genes in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli. Method. The study was a cross-sectional study carried out from July 2018 to June 2019. One hundred and thirty-five nonrepetitive E. coli isolates obtained from various clinical samples were screened for carbapenemase production using meropenem (10 μg) and imipenem (10 μg) disks. Screened-positive isolates were further subjected to a confirmatory test using modified carbapenem inhibition method (mCIM). Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from all the isolates to detect colistin-resistant genes by polymerase chain reaction. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 8.00 for Windows and IBM SPSS version 26 (IMB Corp. New York, USA). Results. Of the 135 isolates, 2 were screened positive for carbapenemase production but tested negative to mCIM. With the colistin-resistant genes, only mcr-1 and mcr-2_700 bp were detected in 3 of the E. coli isolates, representing 2.2%. The mcr-1 was detected in a high vaginal swab sample of a female aged between 65 and 84 years. Mcr-2_700 bp was also detected in urine and blood samples of the patients. Conclusion. The study investigated the presence of carbapenemase and colistin-resistant genes in E. coli organisms. The absence of carbapenemase in the isolates and the detection of colistin-genes call for strict infection prevention and control practices to prevent their introduction and spread to other bacterial species, respectively.</td>

      <td>Objective. To systematically evaluate the clinical value of tenofovir combined with recombinant human interferon α-2b in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and to provide evidence-based medicine for its popularization and use. Methods. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of tenofovir combined with recombinant human interferon α-2b in the online database of PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, China knowledge Network (CNKI), China VIP database, Wanfang database, and China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) were searched. The data included in this study were extracted by two independent researchers. After extracting the data of the study, the Cochrane manual 5.1.0 standard was used to evaluate the bias risk of all the literature included in this study. RevMan5.4 statistical software was used to analyze the collected data by meta. Results. Entecavir combined with recombinant human interferon α-2b can inhibit the activity of HBV polymerase and improve the inflammatory response of the liver. Recombinant human interferon α-2b can regulate immune function by inducing T cell differentiation and maturation and enhancing the production of cytokines. The systematic evaluation showed that entecavir combined with recombinant human interferon α-2b had higher serum HBeAg negative conversion rate, higher drug safety compared with entecavir alone, and improved liver function and immune status. Conclusion. Tenofovir combined with recombinant human interferon alpha-2b has a high serum HBeAg negative rate and safety profile for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. The combination treatment can improve liver function and immune status in patients, but more studies with higher methodological quality and longer duration of intervention are needed for further validation.</td>

      <td>Introduction: The mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio (MPVLR) and platelet distribution width to lymphocyte ratio (PDWLR) have the potential to serve as markers of inflammation which may indicate disease activity. The mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio and PDWLR were assessed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in this study. Material and methods: Sixty-two patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and 79 controls who were age and gender matched were included. Their sociodemographic information, as well as disease activity scores based on the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), disease duration, current medications, lymphocytes, platelets, platelet distribution width (PDW), and mean platelet volume (MPV), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (anti-dsDNA), and complement components (C3, C4) were recorded. The correlations of MPVLR and PDWLR with disease activity and some laboratory parameters were analyzed. Results: Lupus patients had significantly higher median (interquartile range) values for MPVLR and PDWLR than controls (5.69 [1.16-23.67] vs. 4.40 [2.78-11.93], p = 0.009) and 10.51 (2.87-79.37) vs. 5.21 (2.88-14.66), p &lt; 0.001] respectively. According to the ROC curve, &lt; 7.53 was the best PDWLR cut-off value for predicting SLE with a sensitivity of 71%, a specificity of 87% and an accuracy of 82.6%, whereas the optimum MPVLR cut-off value was &lt; 6.46 with a sensitivity of 45.2%, a specificity of 88.9% and an accuracy of 76.8%. In addition, MPVLR had a significant positive correlation with SLEDAI (r = 0.34, p = 0.008). However, there was no significant correlation between PDWLR and SLEDAI (r = 0.23, p = 0.067). Furthermore, PDWLR had a significant positive correlation with PDW (r = 0.482, p &lt; 0.001), while MPVLR had a significant negative correlation with C3 level (r = -0.260, p = 0.042). Both PDWLR and MPVLR were positively correlated with nephritis (r = 0.388, p = 0.002; r = 0.246, p = 0.038, respectively). Conclusions: The platelet distribution width to lymphocyte ratio can be considered as an assisting biomarker in the diagnosis of SLE with the other clinical and serological parameters. The mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio may be used in the evaluation of disease activity in SLE patients.</td>

      <td>Introduction: There is a lack of data assessing disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis from Pakistan. We sought to determine the correlation between Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) and disease activity parameters and the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ). Secondarily, we evaluated the concordance of acute phase reactants with disease activity. Material and methods: We prospectively studied 132 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as per the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria, not in clinical remission. Based on the DAS28 score, the patients were divided into low, moderate, and high activity groups. The patients were also categorized according to the elevation of acute phase reactants to determine concordance and discordance with DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP. Descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlation were computed. Results: Complete demographics was available for 132 participants. The mean age was 46.2 ±12.8 years; there were 85.6% (n = 113) females. The mean disease duration was 5.7 ±6.4 years. The (Rephrase as mean ±SD) DAS28 and mHAQ scores were 3.4 ±1.8 and 0.77 ±0.68, respectively. A significant correlation was observed between DAS28 and tender and swollen joint count (r = 0.64; p &lt; 0.001); DAS28 and mHAQ (r = 0.47; p-value &lt; 0.001), DAS28 and patient's global assessment (PGA) (r = 0.45; p-value &lt; 0.001). A weak correlation was observed between mHAQ and CRP and ESR, with r = 0.242 and 0.225, respectively, p-value &lt; 0.001. In comparison, no correlation of DAS28 with the rheumatoid factor (r = -0.035) or ACPA antibody (r = -0.094) was noted. A positive concordance between ESR and CRP was observed in severely active RA. Conclusions: From an outpatient setting in a South Asian country, DAS28-ESR emerged as the preferred choice for an accurate assessment of disease severity in RA when combined with the mHAQ. Acute phase reactants increase positively in concordance with severely active RA, although discordant in low to moderately active disease.</td>

Olfactory dysfunction was seen more often in mild coronavirus disease 19 patients. Coronavirus disease 19 infection was more severe in elderly patients and it was milder in women. Dyspnea and cough, suggesting involvement in the lower respiratory tract, were significantly higher in the group with a severe course. The olfactory dysfunction lasted significantly shorter in patients with nasal symptoms. In 34.02% of the patients, olfactory dysfunction was the first symptom, and coronavirus disease 19 infection was significantly milder in patients whose first symptom was olfactory dysfunction. There were 39 patients (group A; 40.2%) whose olfactory dysfunction lasted 0-7 days, 36 patients (group B; 37.1%) whose olfactory dysfunction lasted 8-30 days, and 22 patients (group C; 22.7%) whose olfactory dysfunction lasted longer than 30 days. Conclusion: Olfactory dysfunction is a common and important symptom of coronavirus disease 19 infection, and its clinic and incidence frequency in societies has not been fully determined. It was observed that the majority of patients recovered within a month.</td>

      <td>Emphasizing the importance of successful eradication of Helicobacter pylori on initial treatment</td>
      <td>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the most important risk factor for gastric cancer and plays an initiating role in the development of intestinal-type gastric cancer. Eradication of H. pylori significantly reduces the incidence and mortality of gastric cancer. International expert consensus recommends eradication treatment for all infected individuals unless competing considerations. However, large-scale H. pylori eradication treatments have led to increasing rates of resistance to multiple antibiotics, together with factors such as coccoid transformation, host CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms, and inappropriate treatment regimens, resulting in a gradual decline in H. pylori eradication rates. Currently, empirical and repeated eradication of H. pylori treatment is common in clinical practice, which will certainly lead to a further increase in antibiotic resistance, resulting in a great waste of medical resources and an increased psychological burden on patients and their relatives. Therefore, successful eradication of H. pylori on initial treatment should be given high priority, and the implementation of personalized treatment is essential.</td>

      <td>Chickenpox is a very contagious childhood disease with a self-limited course. It is most common in children up to 10 years old, but can infect a person at any age. Varicella presents with itchy pseudo-polymorphic rash (macula, papula, vesicle, crust) and mild intoxication syndrome. The disease is benign and uncomplicated in general, but complications can occur regardless of immune status and concomitant diseases. Neurological and respiratory are among the most common complications. In the patients described in this article, we can observe secondary bacterial superinfection (pyoderma and phlegmon). These are the third most common complications of varicella, and may have serious consequences. These cases are presented to call attention to proper skincare in a patient with chickenpox and to the choice of an appropriate antipyretic to control fever. It is also important to emphasise the importance of vaccination against this disease and to combat the misconceptions of anti-vaxxers.</td>

      <td>Objective. The study aimed to determine the effect of azithromycin combined with palm massage on the pulmonary function of children suffering from mycoplasma pneumonia, as well as associated complications. Methods. A total of 60 cases of children suffering from mycoplasma pneumonia admitted to our hospital from May 2018 to May 2020 were selected as study subjects and assigned to either the observation group or the control group. Lung function indices and changes in the levels of inflammatory markers were measured before and after treatment in both groups, and the results were compared to assess treatment efficacy. Results. There was no statistically significant difference in lung function indices between the two groups before treatment (P&gt;0.05), while there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups after treatment (P&lt;0.05), with the observation group outperforming the control group. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in the levels of such inflammatory markers as IL-6 and TNF-α between the two groups before treatment (P&gt;0.05). After treatment, there was a decrease in the levels of inflammatory markers in both groups, but a much larger decrease was seen in the observation group (P&lt;0.05) than in the control group. The total treatment efficacy in the observation group was 93.3%, which was significantly higher than that of 70.0% in the control group (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion. The application of palm massage combined with azithromycin in the treatment of children suffering from mycoplasma pneumonia produces outstanding results in terms of relieving symptoms and improving pulmonary function.</td>

      <td>Clinical Significance of Inflammatory Factors, Osteocalcin, and Matrix Metalloproteinase-8 in Gingival Crevicular Fluid in Drug Treatment of Severe Periodontitis</td>
      <td>Whether gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) indexes in patients with severe periodontitis affect the efficacy of drug treatment was a new direction of recent research. At present, there were few studies on the effects of inflammatory indicators, BGP, and MMP-8 levels in GCF on the efficacy of drug treatment in such patients. So the purpose of this study was to observe the changes in osteocalcin (BGP), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), and inflammatory indexes levels in GCF of patients with severe periodontitis. The correlation between the above indexes and the effect of drug treatment in the patients was analyzed, in order to provide guidance for improving the clinical curative effect of severe periodontitis. A retrospective analysis was conducted to collect the baseline data of patients with severe periodontitis who were treated with Minocycline Hydrochloride Ointment in our hospital. The inflammatory indicators, BGP, and MMP-8 levels in GCF were analyzed before drug treatment, and the treatment effect on the patients was counted. Logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between BGP, MMP-8, and inflammatory indicators levels in GCF and the drug treatment effect on the patients. After statistical analysis, we found that the response rate was 69% and the inefficiency was 31%. There were no significant differences in C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels between the inefficacy group and efficacy group (P&gt;0.05). Compared with the efficacy group, the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-8 (IL-8), BGP, and MMP-8 were increased in the inefficacy group. High levels of IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, BGP, and MMP-8 were associated with ineffective drug treatment in patients with severe periodontitis (all OR &gt;1 and P&lt;0.05). Levels of IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, BGP, and MMP-8 predicted that the AUCs of drug treatment failure in patients with severe periodontitis were all greater than 0.7, which were 1.398, 1.458, 1.244, 1.012, and 1.012, respectively. From this, we can conclude that increased levels of BGP, MMP-8, and inflammatory indicators such as IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 in GCF would increase the risk of ineffective drug treatment in patients with severe periodontitis. The clinical treatment plan could be adjusted according to the levels of the above indicators in GCF to improve the effectiveness of drug treatment in patients.</td>

      <td>Introduction: Varicella is an infectious disease with potentially severe and not uncommon complications. Aim of the study was to assess the occurrence of neurological complications of varicella-zoster virus among hospitalised children and to analyse the specific clinical picture and outcome. Material and methods: This retrospective study reviewed the medical records and collected post-hospitalisation interviews of children admitted to the hospital for varicella complications between January 2009 and December 2018. None of the patients was vaccinated. Patients were divided into two groups: neurological and non-neurological complications. Statistical analysis of the data was performed, and the results were compared with published data. Results: Of the 484 patients admitted to the hospital with chickenpox, 71 (14.7%) met the study assumption of neurological complications. The median age of subjects in the study group was 4.3 years old (2 months to 16 years). The leading causes for hospitalisation in the study group were: cerebellar ataxia (39.4%), convulsions (26.8%), meningitis and encephalitis (14.1% each). An association between age and type of neurological complication was found. Rates of hospitalisation decreased with age, and the highest was found in children in the first six years of life. No laboratory parameter was found to be a prognostic factor for the development of neurological consequences. The majority of patients showed no comorbidity and hence were not considered as potentially at risk of a severe course of illness. The clinical outcome at one-year follow-up was favourable in most patients (64 of 71, 91.5%). One child died (1.4%). Conclusions: The potential severity of neurological complications and sequelae of chickenpox in unvaccinated children is significant. Even though neurological complications of chickenpox may not result in long-term effects, they significantly prolong hospitalisation.</td>

Most of the patients present with predominant facial, oculo-bulbar, and neck muscle weakness along with respiratory muscle involvement. Such a presentation can be mistaken for bulbar onset motor neuron disease or as one of the rare oculopharyngeal myopathies. Case Report. We present a young female patient, who reported to us with neck muscle weakness, ocular and bulbar muscle paralysis, and breathing difficulty. She had been healthy till she was prescribed hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) tablets (400 mg per day) for a malar rash. By the end of the second week after commencing the HCQ therapy, she developed the muscle weakness. Her symptoms began to regress after stopping HCQ and starting steroids, pyridostigmine, and, subsequently, azathioprine. She was negative for anticholinesterase receptor antibodies (AChR-Ab) but was positive for MuSK antibodies (MuSK-Ab). Conclusion. This report proves that MuSK-MG can also be unmasked by HCQ administration. Awareness of drug-induced/-unmasked MG is important, as failure to do so may result in a severe morbidity and a fatal outcome. The offending drug has to be promptly discontinued, and appropriate treatment should be instituted.</td>

Some of the rare manifestations of Lyme disease include SIADH-like syndrome, enteroparesis, and urinary retention. Case Report. A 69-year-old male presented with anorexia and constipation and was found to have hyponatremia. Several days after admission, Bell's palsy developed and he experienced urinary retention requiring catheterization. Lyme disease was confirmed on serology, and he recalled a rash on his elbow four weeks prior. Ceftriaxone was started and the patient improved; he had multiple bowel movements after receiving laxatives and the Foley catheter was removed; serum sodium normalized with fluid restriction. He was discharged home and was well with symptoms completely resolved at three-month follow-up. Discussion. There should be a high alert of atypical presentation of this common tick bite associated infection. Review of the literature revealed ten similar cases, but only three of these patients were reported to have a combination of SIADH, urinary retention, and enteroparesis.</td>

In the community, about 80% of UTIs are caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), but there is a high variability of etiological agents involved in hospital-acquired UTIs. With this context in mind, the current study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of the main etiological agents responsible for UTIs and their susceptibility profile at the Hospital das Clínicas de Ribeirão Preto, a high complexity reference hospital in the Southeast region of Brazil. This retrospective and descriptive study analyzed all positive inpatient cultures [100,000 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL] from November 2016 to April 2017. The most prevalent microorganism was Klebsiella pneumoniae (23 isolates), equivalent to 37.7% of positive urocultures. The second most prevalent agent was UPEC, with 19 isolates (31.1%). The risk factors evaluated in these inpatients showed that 17.5% underwent a urological procedure on admission, 31.6% were using a urinary catheter; 26.2% were using immunosuppressive drugs during the period in which the clinical diagnosis was made. Our results demonstrate the prevalence of UTI causes in the hospital context and the main risk factors for them and will be pretty helpful in guiding empirical treatment in severe UTIs inside the hospital as well as reflect on the actual need and time duration of invasive procedures in the hospital environment.</td>

Of these, 58 patients remained in progress with no outcomes. Most women were aged between 20 and 34 years, educated to high school level, lived in urban areas, and were in the third trimester of pregnancy at the time of diagnosis. Predominant clinical manifestation was cough, respiratory distress, fever, and dyspnea. The most frequent comorbidities were asthma, chronic cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. 19.7% of pregnant and postpartum women were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Of these, 70.6% needed invasive mechanical ventilation, 80.2% antiviral therapy, and 79 patients (10.3%) died.

      <td>Mucormycosis is a rare opportunistic fungal infection with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. It classically presents with rapidly progressing, necrotic rhinocerebral mucocutaneous lesions in the setting of an immunocompromised host, especially with concomitant uncontrolled diabetes. We report the case of a 67-year-old man with well-controlled non-insulin dependent diabetes and brief steroid exposure who presented in sepsis with a tender posterior shoulder skin lesion. The initial lesion enlarged and progressed over several days, developing central areas of ecchymosis and bullae, with several other large lesions appearing at various distant sites. He also experienced an array of systemic symptoms, including fever, malaise, weakness, and acute encephalopathy. A diagnosis of mucor was made by histopathological examination of the initial skin lesion. Despite initiation of amphotericin B and aggressive surgical debridement including transfer to specialist tertiary burn center, the patient passed away less than a week after definitive diagnosis. This is a unique case of disseminated mucormycosis given his lack of chronic immunosuppression or uncontrolled diabetes, and with no risk factors for inoculation except for pacemaker placement 2 months prior to admission. The case highlights the importance of considering mucormycosis in the early differential diagnosis of rapidly progressing skin lesions, as rapid detection and treatment is critical to mitigate the deadly effects of this fast-moving fatal fungus. Moreover, the case serves as a testament to the unpredictable progression of disseminated disease, while also demonstrating an unusual potential mode of introduction and a rare but fatal consequence of prescribing corticosteroids in an infected host.</td>

Previous studies have shown prevention of sepsis with immune modulation in patients with ACLF and decompensated cirrhosis. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) lead to septic shock and multi-organ failure. We studied the efficacy of adding GM-CSF to imipenem and tigecycline in these patients. Methods: Consecutive patients of cirrhosis with SBP and septic shock were enrolled and randomized into imipenem and tigecycline (Gr.A) and imipenem, tigecycline and GM-CSF (Gr.B). Standard dose of Imipenem and tigecycline were administered in both groups and intravenous GM-CSF 500mcg administered as infusion over 24 hours for 5 days and followed up till day-28. Primary objective included resolution of SBP at day 5. Secondary objective included response at day 2, reversal of shock, development of complications (HE, AKI, pneumonia, coagulopathy) and survival at 7-day and 28-day. Results: Overall, 90 patients were enrolled and randomized into the two groups. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups age, organ failures, serum creatinine, serum bilirubin, ascitic fluid analysis, serum lactate, procalcitonin, CTP, MELD and APACHE score. In Gr A compared to Gr.

We aimed to assess the long-term effect of antiviral drugs on chronic hepatitis B infection in ESRD patients after renal transplant. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of consecutive HBV infected renal transplant patients (in whom HBV was diagnosed prior to transplant) who presented for follow-up from November 2021 to May 2022 at the Liver Clinic of a tertiary academic institute. Results: Fifteen post-renal transplant patients with chronic HBV infection were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 43.4 years, and only 2 (13.3%) patients were female. At the time of diagnosis, majority of the patients [8, (53.3%)] had HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis followed by 5 (33.3%) patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis, and 2 (13.3%) patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection as per EASL proposed nomenclature. None of the patients had HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection at presentation. The median AST and ALT values at diagnosis were 45 (33.75-76.28) units/L and 52 (34-121.8) units/L, respectively. All patients were started on antiviral drugs pre or peri-transplant and included either tenofovir, entecavir or lamivudine in 7 (46.5%), 5 (26.6%) and 3 (20%) patients. At last follow-up, virologic response was seen in 10 (66.7%) patients and viral breakthroughs were not observed in any patient. Median ALT [40 (29.5-92)] was significantly lower than that at baseline (p=0.04) and was normal in 8 (53.3%) patients. No major side effects were reported by any patient.

      <td>The Increasing Recognition of Transthyretin Cardiac Amyloidosis (ATTR-CA): Patient Characteristics and Survival in the Australian Context</td>
      <td>Background: Despite increasing awareness and treatments for ATTR-CA, true incidence and patient outcomes of the disease in Australia remain unclear. We wished to evaluate the epidemiology, characteristics and survival of ATTR-CA at an Australian state amyloidosis service. Methods: All patients reviewed at the Victorian and Tasmanian Amyloidosis Service with ATTR-CA from July 2014 to July 2021 were included. Patient characteristics and survival data were retrospectively collected. Results: 245 ATTR-CA patients were identified. Diagnoses have increased &gt;440% since 2014. Median age was 80 years (range 75–84); 228 (93.1%) were male. 51.4% had Gillmore Stage I, 34.3% Stage II and 14.3% Stage III at diagnosis. 11/84 (13.1%) had hereditary disease, 73/84 (86.9%) were wildtype, and 34 (14.2%) had an unrelated MGUS. 129 (53.5%) had AF at diagnosis. Bone scintigraphy was the most common investigation (99.2%). 36.1% underwent confirmatory cardiac (13.8%) or bone marrow biopsies (13.1%). 90% commenced specific treatment for ATTR-CA: diflunisal (44.1%), doxycycline (44.0%) green tea extract (48.6%), tafamidis (11.8%) or enrolled onto placebo-controlled trials with acoramidis (6.9%) or patisiran (3.7%). With median follow-up of 21 months, estimated overall survival was 71.3, 49.3 and 29.4 months for Gilmore Stage I, II and III, respectively, slightly better than reported in the original Circulation paper. Conclusion: ATTR-CA diagnoses in Australia are increasing, with patient characteristic similar to reports elsewhere. Estimated survival is better than original reports, possibly reflecting greater uptake of disease-modifying therapies.</td>

      <td>Food Safety is an important topic for public health and international trade in food. Residues of veterinary drugs and environmental contaminants in animal products can cause diseases and acute toxicity in organisms exposed to these substances. This study evaluated official monitoring data of veterinary drug residues from the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply in tissues of poultry and swine in the period between 2002 and 2014 to check for hidden patterns in the occurrence of six common drugs (Closantel, Diclazuril, Nicarbazin, Sulfaquinoxaline, Doxycycline and Sulfamethazinein). The analysis of data was performed by using two machine learning methods: decision tree and neural networks, in addition to visual evaluation through graphs and maps. Contamination rates were low, varying from 0 to 0.66%. A spatial distribution pattern of detections of substances by region was identified, but no pattern of temporal distribution was observed. Nevertless, regressions showed an increase in levels when these substances were detected, so monitoring should continue. However, the results show that the products monitored during the study period presented a low risk to public health.</td>

      <td>Bacteria of the genus Nocardia are implicated in several disease processes but are a rare cause of septic arthritis. Typically, the cause of Nocardia septic arthritis is dissemination from a pulmonary infection in an immunocompromised host. Herein we present a case of a 64-year-old male who had received a long course of prednisone for membranous nephropathy and developed a septic arthritis due to Nocardia brasiliensis. He was treated sequentially with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin-clavulanate, linezolid and amoxicillin-clavulanate, tigecycline and amoxicillin-clavulanate, and omadacycline and amoxicillin-clavulanate. To our knowledge, only two prior cases of Nocardia brasiliensis septic arthritis without antecedent trauma to the joint or local skin breakdown have been reported. A review of the literature identified 19 other cases of Nocardia septic arthritis.

      <td>Investigation of the Relationship between Chronic Endometritis Manifestations under Hysteroscope and CD138 Expression</td>
      <td>Background and Objective. Chronic endometritis (CE) displays different manifestations under hysteroscope and yields different CD138 immunohistochemistry (IHC) outcomes. This study was designed to probe links across different CE manifestations under hysteroscopy and the IHC outcome of CD138, as well as the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. Methods. This study was performed to retrospectively analyze clinical cases of 523 CE patients from January 2018 to June 2020 that were confirmed by hysteroscopy before in vitro fertilization. Based on manifestations of CE under hysteroscopy, the cases were divided into three cohorts, i.e., hyperemia cohort where the patients had diffuse endometrium hyperemia; endometrial micropolyp cohort, and endometrial stroma edema and hyperplasia cohort. Small amount of endometrial tissue was collected from the patients, and CD138 IHC examination was performed. According to the results of CD138 IHC, positive patients were given antibiotic treatment (doxycycline 100 mg BID orally for 14 days), and hysteroscopy was performed again after treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotics. Results. In the comparison of overall status for all patient cohorts, infertility type, BMI, bFSH, bLH, bP, bT, PRL, AMH, and CA125 were varied markedly across all cohorts (P&lt;0.05), with predominant incidences of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) peaking within hyperemia cohort. Incidence/diagnostic rate for CD138 within hyperemia cohort was 10.06%, which was lower than the 63.16% in micropolyp cohort and 74% in edema and hyperplasia cohort (P&lt;0.05). No major variation existed within CD138 across micropolyp cohort/edema and hyperplasia cohort (P&gt;0.05). After CD138-positive CE patients were treated with antibiotics, the effective rate (0/16) within hyperemia cohort was lower than micropolyp cohort (73.61%, 53/72) and edema and hyperplasia cohort (83.24%, 154/185) (P&lt;0.05). The effective rate across micropolyp cohort/edema and hyperplasia cohort was not significantly different (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion. Cases of diffuse endometrial hyperemia under hysteroscope had the lowest positive rate of CD138, and the effect of antibiotic treatment on these patients was poor. The positive rate of CD138 in patients with endometrial micropolyps and endometrial stroma edema and hyperplasia under hysteroscope was high, and the effect of antibiotic treatment was better.</td>

      <td>Objective. To investigate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic tympanic membrane catheterization and ofloxacin ear drops in the treatment of secretory otitis media in infants and toddlers. Methods. A total of 80 children suffering from secretory otitis media who underwent treatment in our hospital from July 2018 to April 2020 were divided into the control group (n = 40) and experimental group (n = 40) by randomization. The control group was treated with endoscopic tympanic membrane catheterization alone, while the experimental group was treated with ofloxacin ear drops based on the same treatment as the control group. The treatment effect, air conduction hearing level, clearance rate of pathogenic bacteria secreted by the ear canal, recurrence rate, and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. Results. The treatment in the experimental group led to a significantly better outcome than that in the control group (P&lt;0.05). After treatment, a substantially improved air conduction hearing level in the experimental group was observed (P&lt;0.001). A chi-square test showed a significantly higher clearance rate of pathogenic bacteria secreted from the ear canal of the children in the experimental group compared to that of the control group (P&lt;0.05). The treatment in the experimental group resulted in a lower recurrence rate and adverse reaction rate as compared to the control group (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion. Concurrent endoscopic tympanic membrane catheterization and ofloxacin ear drops showed excellent efficacy in the treatment of secretory otitis media in infants and toddlers. The therapy offers promising solutions for the improvement of hearing level, increase of clearance rate of pathogenic bacteria secreted from the ear canal, and decrease of disease recurrence and adverse reactions during treatment.</td>

To investigate the efficacy of gamma globulin combined with azithromycin sequential therapy in the treatment of children with refractory mycoplasma pneumonia and its effect on Th1/Th2 cytokine levels. Method. From January 2021 to January 2022, 100 children diagnosed with refractory mycoplasma pneumonia were randomly divided into 2 groups (50 cases in each one), the control group was treated with azithromycin plus comprehensive basic treatment, and the treatment group was treated with combined treatment on the basis of the control group, gamma globulin therapy; the treatment effect and cytokine levels of the two groups were compared. Results. Th1, Th2, and Th1/Th2 before treatment were not significantly different between the two groups. Th1, Th2, and Th1/Th2 in the treatment group were significantly downregulated compared with those in the control group after treatment. The levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM in the treatment group were not significantly different from those in the control group before treatment but were significantly upregulated after treatment. IL-10, IL-6, and IL-2 levels were also significantly increased in the treatment group. The disappearance time of clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, and pulmonary rales in the treatment group was significantly shorter than that in the control group, and the cure rate in the treatment group was significantly better than that in the control group. Conclusion. The clinical effect of gamma globulin combined with azithromycin sequential therapy in the treatment of children with refractory mycoplasma pneumonia is remarkable, which can reduce inflammatory factors, improve patients' immunity, and promote disease recovery.</td>

      <td>Inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus Efflux Pump by O-Eugenol and Its Toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster Animal Model</td>
      <td>Background. Efflux pumps are transmembrane proteins that expel drugs out of a bacterial cell contributing to microorganism drug resistance. Several studies addressing the use of natural products with medicinal properties have intensified given the above. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the antibacterial activity and the O-eugenol potential in Staphylococcus aureus resistance reversal by efflux pump inhibition, as well as to evaluate its toxicity in the Drosophila melanogaster arthropod model. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the O-eugenol efflux pump inhibition. For the D. melanogaster toxicity assays, mortality and locomotor system damage were performed using the fumigation method. Results. O-eugenol presented a MIC of 1024 μg/mL against S. aureus. The association of this compound with the antibiotic tetracycline demonstrated a synergistic effect (p&lt;0.0001), this also being observed when the antibiotic was associated with ethidium bromide (p&lt;0.0001); thus, these results may be attributable to an efflux pump inhibition. The D. melanogaster mortality and geotaxis assays revealed the compound is toxic, with an EC50 of 18 μg/mL within 48 hours of exposure. Conclusions. While we can conclude that the tested product has an efflux pump inhibitory effect, further studies are needed to elucidate its mechanisms of action, in addition to assays using other strains to verify whether the substance has the same inhibitory effect.</td>

      <td>Questions have been raised apropos the emerging problem of microbial resistance, which may pose a great hazard to the human health. Among biosafe compounds are essential oils which captured consumer draw due to their multifunctional properties compared to chemical medication drugs. Here, we examined the chemical profile and the mechanism(s) of action of the Thymus vulgaris essential oil (TVEO) against a Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella enterica Typhimurium ATTCC 10028 (S. enterica Typhimurium ATTCC 10028) and two Gram-positive bacteria Staphyloccocus aureus ATCC 6538 (S. aureus ATCC 6538) and Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19117 (L. monocytogenes ATCC 19117). Findings showed that TVEO was principally composed of thymol, o-cymene, and γ-terpinene with 47.44, 16.55, and 7.80%, respectively. Molecular docking simulations stipulated that thymol and β-sesquiphellandrene (a minor compound at 1.37%) could target multiple bacterial pathways including topoisomerase II and DNA and RNA polymerases of the three tested bacteria. This result pointed plausible impairments of the pathogenic bacteria cell replication and transcription processes. Through computational approach, the VEGA quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model, we revealed that among twenty-six TVEO compounds, sixteen had no toxic effects and could be safe for human consumption as compared to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs (ciprofloxacin and rifamycin SV). Assessed by the SwissADME server, the pharmacokinetic profile of all identified TVEO compounds define their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties and were assessed. In order to predict their biological activity spectrum based on their chemical structure, all TVEO compounds were subjected to PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) online tool. Results indicated that the tested compounds could have multiple biological activities and various enzymatic targets. Findings of our study support that identified compounds of TVEO can be a safe and effective alternative to synthetic drugs and can easily combats hazardous multidrug-resistant bacteria.</td>

      <td>Effectiveness of Paliperidone Palmitate on Treatment Adherence and Relapse in the Adult Schizophrenia Population: A One-Year Mirror-Image Study in a Colombian Mental Health Care Facility</td>
      <td>Introduction: The benefits of long-acting injectable antipsychotics have been documented in several observational studies, but data remain scarce in Latin America. This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of paliperidone palmitate once monthly (PP1M) on treatment adherence and relapse in the schizophrenia population followed in a government-funded mental health care facility in Colombia. Methods: A mirror-image study was conducted. Adult schizophrenia patients treated with oral antipsychotics who subsequently received ≥2 PP1M injections between Jan. 1(st), 2015 and Oct. 31(st), 2018 were included. The study consisted of two retrospective phases: 12 months before and after the first PP1M injection. Outcomes were treatment adherence (proportion of days covered ≥80%), hospitalized relapse, hospital length of stay, and non-hospitalised relapse. Effect of PP1M on outcomes was assessed through multivariable conditional Poisson regression. Results: 123 patients were eligible (mean age, 30.3 years; 79.7% males). Adherence was 23.6% in the pre-phase and 89.4% in the post-phase (RR = 3.77; 95%CI, 2.75-5.17). The proportion of patients with hospitalised relapse decreased from 46.3% to 35.0% (RR = 0.76; 95%CI, 0.59-0.99). In the 75 (61.0%) patients who continued PP1M throughout post-phase, beneficial effect on hospitalised relapse was stronger (RR = 0.64; 95%CI, 0.42-0.98). The proportion of patients with non-hospitalised relapse symptoms increased from 6.5% to 18.7% (RR = 2.27; 95%CI, 1.11-4.64). Conclusions: PP1M initiation led to a dramatic improvement in treatment adherence and a decrease in hospitalised relapse. Observed increase in non-hospitalised relapse may be explained by a decrease in severity. Limitations are absence of a parallel comparison group and a generalisability limited to the population treated at this facility. Study provides data for the Latin America region and strength is the assessment of non-hospitalised relapse symptoms.</td>

Antipsychotic (AP) treatment, including long-acting injectable (LAI) AP in subjects with poor compliance, is prescribed to manage behavioural and psychotic symptomatology. Objectives: We describe a 70-year-old woman who was hospitalised after experiencing new-onset delusions of infestation with visual and tactile hallucinations that led to bizarre behaviours and progressive social withdrawal. Methods: She was diagnosed with ES and was initially treated with risperidone 3 mg; however, due to poor compliance and a lack of insight, she was switched to LAI palmitate paliperidone (LAI-PP). She was followed up for 8 months, administering Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Global Assessment of Functioning, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, neurocognitive assessment, and neuroimaging. Results: After a progressive cognitive deterioration, she was diagnosed with an ES secondary to Lewy body dementia (DLB). Conclusion: The LAI-PP treatment determined a complete clinical remission of psychotic symptoms despite the emergence of an iatrogenic akinetic-rigid syndrome. The delay of confirmatory neurological diagnosis, the associated risky behaviours of the patient, and poor treatment adherence led clinicians to prescribe LAI-PP following a good clinical response to oral paliperidone. However, in the case of a suspected DLB diagnosis, the prescription of an LAI-PP as a first-line strategy should be carefully evaluated.</td>

Less is known regarding the impact of both manure application methods on surface transport of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in manure-amended fields. We applied liquid dairy manure to field plots by surface application and subsurface injection and simulated rainfall on the first or seventh day following application. The ARG richness, relative abundance (normalized to 16s rRNA), and ARG profiles in soil and surface runoff were monitored using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Within 1 day of manure application, compared to unamended soils, soils treated with manure had 32.5-70.5% greater ARG richness and higher relative abundances of sulfonamide (6.5-129%) and tetracycline (752-3766%) resistance genes (p ≤ 0.05). On day 7, soil ARG profiles in the surface-applied plots were similar to, whereas subsurface injection profiles were different from, that of the unamended soils. Forty-six days after manure application, the soil ARG profiles in manure injection slits were 37% more diverse than that of the unamended plots. The abundance of manure-associated ARGs were lower in surface runoff from manure subsurface injected plots and carried a lower resistome risk score in comparison to surface-applied plots. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that although manure subsurface injection reduces ARGs in the runoff, it can create potential long-term hotspots for elevated ARGs within injection slits.</td>

      <td>Background: The introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) to treat the hepatitis C virus (HCV) overcame many drawbacks of interferon-based therapy. DAA achieved sustained viral response (SVR) rates above 90% and overcame many drawbacks of pegylated interferon regimens.The HCV genotype (GT) distribution varies by geographical area, with GT-4 being most prevalent in the Middle East region, including Saudi Arabia. Yet, the real-world evidence about using DAAs in the Saudi population is limited.Thus, the aim of this study to investigate the effectiveness and safety of DAAs in Saudi patients with HCV infection. Methods: A retrospective cohort study included patients treated with DAAs from 2015 to 2017 at a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All patients with HCV treated with either ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir (LDS/SOF) ± ribavarin (RBV) or ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r) ± dasabuvir (DSV) ± RBV were included. Using a per-protocol analysis, the effectiveness outcome was the end-of-treatment response (EOTr) and Sustained virologic reponce12 weeks after competing the regimen (SVR12). The secondary safety outcome was the adverse event related to the therapy reported by the patients. Results: A total of 97 patients were included; with the majority infected with GT-4 (64 %), followed by GT-1 (18 %), in addition to 8 % having a mixed GT (1 + 4). The EOTr and SVR12 rates were 98 % and 96 %, respectively. SVR12 was 94.4 % within the LDS/SOF ± RBV group and 97.7 % within the OBV/PTV/r ± DSV ± RBV group. Only 4 % had a response failure due to relapse or breakthrough, and all were infected with mixed GT1 + 4. Medications were well tolerated with minimal side effects, including vomiting, nausea, and weakness. Conclusion: DAAs regimens are associated with high rates of SVR12 and are well tolerated with a good safety profile in Saudi HCV-infected patients.</td>

      <td>Shared psychotic disorder – a case study of folie à famille</td>
      <td>– BACKGROUND: Folie à famille is a rare form of shared psychotic disorder. It is defined as the transfer of delusions from one person to another. CASE REPORT: This paper presents a case of shared psychotic disorder in two brothers, aged 16 and 17 and their mother who were admitted on the same day at the Clinic for psychiatry. The inducer was a mother, suffering from schizophrenia. She transferred her delusions to her sons. Both boys produced mostly the same paranoid delusions, that the others have been recording and monitoring them since their father died. After few days, the older boy, who had more severe psychotic symptoms, was treated with aripiprazole, while both received anxiolytics in low dosage. RESULTS: We observed a withdrawal of psychotic psychopathology in both kids. Genetic burden, social isolation and strong emotional connection of family members are factors that have contributed to the development of shared psychotic disorder in this case. CONCLUSIONS: The new approach of treatment for induced psychosis includes not only separation from the primary case, but also specific pharmacotherapy. It is necessary to think about this clinical entity, because this delusional disorder needs specific treatment, with better prognostic outcomes.</td>

      <td>Molecular genetic testing does not improve the detection of fluoroquinolone resistance before transrectal prostate biopsy</td>
      <td>Background: Fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQR) Escherichia coli (E. coli) causes transrectal prostate biopsy infections. We seek to further identify fluoroquinolones resistance by the incorporation of genetic profiling to influence antibiotic selection for transrectal prostate biopsy and whether the addition of this genetic testing could improve the prediction of FQR detection at the time of biopsy. Materials and methods: In this prospective observational cohort study, rectal swabs were collected within 30 days of an upcoming prostate biopsy. These swabs were sent for phenotypic and genotypic assessment to predict FQR on the day of the biopsy. Phenotype: Specimens were inoculated onto MacConkey agar containing ciprofloxacin using standard culture techniques to determine FQR status. Genotype: We compared cultures to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequence typing (E.coli- ST131/H30/ST69) and bacterial plasmids (gyrA, qnrQ, and qnrS). The presence of FQR on this testing was compared to the second rectal swab collected just before biopsy (2 hours after ciprofloxacin prophylaxis), which served as the gold standard for FQR. Results: Overall, the FQR rate was 23.6%. The bacterial plasmids (qnr) were present in 54.1% of samples, and multidrug-resistant E. coli ST131 was present in 12.5% of samples. In comparison, phenotypic assessment using rectal culture had a better prediction for the presence of FQR as compared to genotypic testing [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.85 in phenotype arm vs. AUC = 0.45 in genotype arm]. Conclusion: We detected a high prevalence of FQR genes in the rectum, but the addition of PCR-based genotyping did not improve the prediction of culture-based FQR at the time of biopsy.</td>

      <td>Off-label use of azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin (the "COVID kit") has been suggested for COVID-19 treatment in Brazil without clinical or scientific evidence of efficacy. These drugs have known adverse drug reactions (ADR). This study aimed to analyze if the sales of drugs in the "COVID kit" are correlated to the reported number of ADR after the COVID-19 pandemic began. Data was obtained from the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa) website on reported sales and ADRs for azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin for all Brazilian states. The period from March 2019 to February 2020 (before the pandemic) was compared to that from March 2020 to February 2021 (during the pandemic). Trend adjustment was performed for time series data and cross-correlation analysis to investigate correlation between sales and ADR within the same month (lag 0) and in the following months (lag 1 and lag 2). Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess the magnitude of the correlations. After the pandemic onset, sales of all investigated drugs increased significantly (69.75% for azithromycin, 10,856,481.39% for hydroxychloroquine, and 12,291,129.32% for ivermectin). ADR levels of all medications but azithromycin were zero before the pandemic, but increased after its onset. Cross-correlation analysis was significant in lag 1 for all drugs nationwide. Spearman's correlation was moderate for azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine but absent for ivermectin. Data must be interpreted cautiously since no active search for ADR was performed. Our results show that the increased and indiscriminate use of "COVID kit" during the pandemic correlates to an increased occurrence of ADRs</td>

      <td>Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population. However, epidemiological studies on the demographics of AD in Hong Kong population are lacking. Objective: We investigated the demographics, comorbidities, mortality rates, and medication use of patients with AD in Hong Kong to understand how the disease has been managed locally. Methods: This was a collaborative study of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the Hospital Authority Data Collaboration Lab. We analyzed the demographic data, clinical records, diagnoses, and medication records of patients with AD under the care of the Hospital Authority between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2017. Results: We identified 23,467 patients diagnosed with AD. The median age at diagnosis was 84 years old, and 71% of patients were female. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (52.6%). 39.9% of patients received medications for dementia; of those, 68.4% had taken those medications for &gt; 1 year. Compared to nonusers, long-term AD medication users had a significantly younger age of AD onset and were taking more lipid-regulating medication, diabetes medication, or antidepressants. Surprisingly, the use of antipsychotics in patients with AD was quite common; 50.7% of patients had received any type of antipsychotic during disease progression. Conclusion: This study provides detailed information on the demographics and medication use of patients with AD in Hong Kong. The data from this AD cohort will aid our future research aiming to identify potential AD risk factors and associations between AD and other diseases.</td>

      <td>Background: Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN) are severe mucocutaneous reactions, considered as variants of same pathologic process. It is characterized by epidermal blisters, necrosis and sloughing predominantly of drug induced etiology. Due to severe cutaneous reactions, the genital manifestations associated with SJS/TEN are less studied. The chronic sequelae of genital manifestations results in severe gynecological, urological and sexual related complications, and have a great impact on the quality of life of patients. Aims And Objectives: To study the genital manifestations associated with SJS/TEN. Materials and Methods: Patients of SJS/TEN attending the Out-patient and In-patient Department of Skin and VD in a tertiary care hospital, having genital manifestations were included in the study. Genital examination of all patients were observed and recorded with a follow up for 6 months. Results: A total of 30 patients, twelve males (40%) and eighteen females (60%), were included. Genital manifestations were observed in 18 (60%) patients, with a male:female ratio of 1:2, i.e. males 6 (36.66%) and females 12 (63.33). All patients presented in the acute stage of the disease. Four female patients (33.3%) developed chronic manifestations in the form of labial synechiae in 2 (16.66%), vaginal synechiae in 1 (8.33%), vaginal strictures in 1 (8.33%) patient. None of the male patients developed chronic sequelae. Conclusion: SJS/TEN are rare diseases, but the mucocutaneous involvement, especially of genitourinary system and their long-term sequelae have a major impact on the quality of life of affected patients. The genital manifestations are largely preventable by means of proper awareness and early intervention.</td>

      <td>Introduction: Chronic HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) are the major causes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and mortality in HIV patients. This study was conducted to look upon the effect of ART on CVD risk markers in patients on different ART regimens and ART-naïve patients. Methods: It was a cross-sectional, observational study done on 120 HIV-infected patients. CV risk markers were assessed and correlated with disease-specific factors within individual subgroups differentiated as Group A (ART naïve), Group B (first-line ART), and Group C (second-line ART). Carotid intimal medial thickness (CIMT) and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) were done to classify cases as having CVD. Results: CVD risk parameters were found to be significantly higher in cases on ART, as compared to ART-naïve cases. The mean CIMT among cases in Group C, Group B, and Group A was 0.072 ± 0.01 cm, 0.063 ± 0.01 cm, and 0.055 ± 0.01 cm, respectively (P &lt; 0.01). 95%, 65% and 25% cases in Group C, Group B, and Group A, respectively, had high CIMT (&gt;0.06 cm) and were seen to be directly correlated with disease-related factors, i.e., duration of disease and ART, type of ART, and low CD4 cell counts. hsCRP was significantly increased in 65 out of total 120 cases. The mean hsCRP in Group A, Group B, and Group C was 3.69 ± 3.37, 4.21 ± 3.4, and 5.72 ± 3.54 mg/L, respectively (P &lt; 0.01), which corresponds to the high risk of CVD. Conclusion: CVD risk parameters of CIMT and hsCRP are seen to be higher in patients on ART than ART-naive subjects.</td>

      <td>Context: Lichen planus (LP) is known to be associated with viral infections such as hepatitis B and C, but its association with HIV is rarely reported. Lichenoid drug eruptions have been implicated as the side effects of anti-retroviral therapy. Aims and Objectives: The aim of this study is to study demographics, clinical, histological, and immunological profile of the HIV patients presenting with lichenoid dermatitis. Subjects and Methods: HIV patients presenting with LP such as lesions were evaluated with complete history and physical examination. Demographic profile of patients was studied with features such as age, sex, duration of disease, distribution of the lesions, CD4 count, concomitant medications, associated comorbidities, and response to the treatment. Results: Twenty-one HIV patients presenting with LP such as lesions were studied. Of these, 20 patients had LP and one patient had lichenoid drug reaction. The age of the patient ranged from 40 to 60 years with no sex predilection. The duration of lesions ranged from 15 days to 7 years. Eleven patients had simultaneous cutaneous and oral involvement, five patients had only oral involvement and four patients of LP and one patient of lichenoid drug reaction had only cutaneous lesions. All the patients were on antiretroviral therapy, mainly on lamivudine, zidovudine, and nevirapine. Almost all the patients had CD4 count of more than 250 at the time of presentation. One patient was diagnosed to have lupus erythematosus and LP overlap. Patients were treated with oral medications such as corticosteroids, methotrexate, and dapsone and topical medications such as corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Conclusions: The appearance of LP such as lesions in HIV patients is a rare occurrence with 11 cases of LP reported till date. Our case series of 20 patients will throw light on possible etiology and difficulties in the management of LP such as lesions in HIV patients.</td>

      <td>Monitoring Autophagy in Neural Stem and Progenitor Cells</td>
      <td>Autophagy is a critical cellular program that is necessary for cellular survival and adaptation to nutrient and metabolic stress. In addition to homeostatic maintenance and adaptive response functions, autophagy also plays an active role during development and tissue regeneration. Within the neural system, autophagy is important for stem cell maintenance and the ability of neural stem cells to undergo self-renewal. Autophagy also contributes toward neurogenesis and provides neural progenitor cells with sufficient energy to mediate cytoskeleton remodeling during the differentiation process. In differentiated neural cells, autophagy maintains neuronal homeostasis and viability by preventing the accumulation of toxic and pathological intracellular aggregates. However, prolonged autophagy or dysregulated upregulation of autophagy can result in autophagic cell death. Moreover, mutations or defects in autophagy that result in neural stem cell instability and cell death underlie many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease. Thus, autophagy plays a multi-faceted role during neurogenesis from the stem cell to the differentiated neural cell. In this chapter, we describe methods to monitor autophagy at the protein and transcript level to evaluate alterations within the autophagy program in neural stem and progenitor cells. We describe immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry approaches for evaluating autophagy-dependent protein modifications, as well as quantitative real-time PCR to assess transcript levels of autophagy genes. As autophagy is a dynamic process, we highlight the importance of using late-stage inhibitors to be able to assess autophagic flux and quantify the level of autophagy occurring within cells.</td>

      <td>NAFLD and NASH: The Metabolically Diseased Liver</td>
      <td>Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, with a global prevalence of approximately 24% in the general population. It is caused by fat accumulation in the liver secondary to insulin resistance, visceral obesity, and/or features of metabolic syndrome. A genetic susceptibility contributes to the phenotype, accounting for a more severe course of liver disease and the observed clinical variability. In fact, despite liver steatosis being considered a relatively benign entity, inflammation related to oxidative stress and lipid-derived damage may lead to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which constitutes the progressive disease. Accumulation of hepatic fibrosis can lead to cirrhosis and provide the environment for hepatocellular carcinoma. Obese and diabetic individuals represent a well-acknowledged high risk population. The assessment of liver fibrosis plays a crucial role in clinical setting, as liver-related mortality increases parallel to fibrosis stage. A liver biopsy is currently considered the reference standard for the diagnosis of NASH and the fibrosis stage, but many non-invasive tools are used with the aim of replacing histology for diagnosis and prognosis purposes. Blood based scores and liver stiffness are the most widely used and validated tools to assess liver fibrosis. Management of NAFLD resides on environmental interventions, including diet and physical activity to induce weight loss, and avoiding harmful nutrients, including fructose-sweetened beverages and high glycemic index foods, that are directly implied in liver injury. Multiple trials with investigational drugs are currently explored to treat fibrosing NASH, with promising results and it can be expected that a liver direct therapy aiming at steatohepatitis and fibrosis will become available soon.</td>

      <td>The pharmacokinetics of voriconazole shows large intra-individual and inter-individual variability and is affected by various factors. Recently, inflammation has been focused as a significant factor affecting the variability. This study aimed to compare the influence of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other clinical laboratory parameters on intra-individual variability in trough voriconazole concentration and examine the impact of inflammation in patients with hematological malignancies. We conducted a retrospective, single-center, observational cohort study. Forty-two patients with hematological malignancy who received oral voriconazole for prophylaxis against deep mycosis and underwent multiple measurements of trough plasma voriconazole concentration were recruited. Quantitative changes in pharmacological and clinical laboratory parameters (Δ) were calculated as the difference between the current and preceding measurements. Voriconazole concentration/maintenance dose per weight (C/D) was found to correlate positively with CRP level (n = 202, rs = 0.314, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, ΔC/D correlated positively with ΔCRP level (n = 160, rs = 0.442, p &lt; 0.001), and ΔCRP showed the highest correlation coefficient among the laboratory parameters. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified ΔCRP (p &lt; 0.001) and Δgamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γGTP) (p = 0.019) as independent factors associated with ΔC/D. Partial R2 were 0.315 for ΔCRP and 0.024 for ΔγGTP, suggesting markedly greater contribution of ΔCRP to ΔC/D. In conclusion, since clinical laboratory parameters other than CRP had little influence on trough plasma voriconazole concentration, therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment considering fluctuation in CRP level would be important for proper use of voriconazole in patients with hematological malignancies.</td>

Taurine also inhibits the content of superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and the mRNA expression of SOD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) in rat kidney tissue. The apoptotic rate of renal cells was decreased by taurine through inhibition of a mitochondrial mechanism. In summary, we found that taurine prevents AFB1-induced renal injury via enhanced antioxidant ability and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis.</td>

      <td>Antibiotic resistance pattern in urine cultures from community-dwelling women in southern Brazil - a cross-sectional study short communication</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVE: The increase in antibiotic resistance (AR) is a global phenomenon with regional variation. This survey aims to describe the AR in urine cultures of women from the community in a southern Brazil city. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional single-center study in urine cultures of community dwelling individuals. The main outcome was the AR profile of bacterial isolates from women in outpatient care. RESULTS: From 4,011 urine cultures, 524 were positive (91% from women). The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (E. coli) (67.0%) and Klebsiella spp. (19.4%). E. coli presented low resistance to nitrofurantoin (3.7%), moderate to levofloxacin (15.6%), amoxacillin-clavulonate (16.4%) and ciprofloxacin (17.4%), and high to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Nitrofurantoin seems to be the best choice for the empirical treatment of low urinary tract infections in women, whereas sulfonamides are no longer an option, since E. coli resistance to this drug is above 20%.</td>

      <td>Online searches of children's oseltamivir in public primary and specialized care: Detecting influenza outbreaks in Finland using dedicated databases for health care professionals</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Health care professionals working in primary and specialized care typically search for medical information from Internet sources. In Finland, Physician's Databases are online portals aimed at professionals seeking medical information. As dosage errors may occur when prescribing medication to children, professionals' need for reliable medical information has increased in public health care centers and hospitals. Influenza continues to be a public health threat, with young children at risk of developing severe illness and easily transmitting the virus. Oseltamivir is used to treat children with influenza. The objective of this study was to compare searches for children's oseltamivir and influenza diagnoses in primary and specialized care, and to determine if the searches could aid detection of influenza outbreaks. METHODS: We compared searches in Physician's Databases for children's oral suspension of oseltamivir (6 mg/mL) for influenza diagnoses of children under 7 years and laboratory findings of influenza A and B from the National Infectious Disease Register. Searches and diagnoses were assessed in primary and specialized care across Finland by season from 2012-2016. The Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) calculated seasonal starts and ends, and paired differences in the mean compared two indicators. Correlation was tested to compare seasons. RESULTS: We found that searches and diagnoses in primary and specialized care showed visually similar patterns annually. The MEM-calculated starting weeks in searches appeared mainly in the same week. Oseltamivir searches in primary care preceded diagnoses by -1.0 weeks (95% CI: -3.0, -0.3; p = 0.132) with very high correlation (τ = 0.913). Specialized care oseltamivir searches and diagnoses correlated moderately (τ = 0.667). CONCLUSION: Health care professionals' searches for children's oseltamivir in online databases linked with the registers of children's influenza diagnoses in primary and specialized care. Therefore, database searches should be considered as supplementary information in disease surveillance when detecting influenza epidemics.</td>

      <td>Tolerability and pharmacokinetic evaluation of inhaled dry powder hydroxychloroquine in healthy volunteers</td>
      <td>RATIONALE: Inhaled antimicrobials enable high local concentrations where needed and, compared to orally administration, greatly reduce the potential for systemic side effects. In SARS-CoV-2 infections, hydroxychloroquine sulphate (HCQ) administered as dry powder via inhalation could be safer than oral HCQ allowing higher and therefore more effective pulmonary concentrations without dose limiting toxic effects. OBJECTIVES: To assess the local tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetic parameters of HCQ inhalations in single ascending doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg using the Cyclops dry powder inhaler. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers were included in the study. Local tolerability and safety were assessed by pulmonary function tests, electrocardiogram and recording adverse events. To estimate systemic exposure, serum samples were collected before and 0.5, 2 and 3.5 h after inhalation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Dry powder HCQ inhalations were well tolerated by the participants, except for transient bitter taste in all participants and minor coughing irritation. There was no significant change in QTc-interval or drop in FEV1 post inhalation. The serum HCQ concentration remained below 10 μg/L in all samples. CONCLUSION: Single doses of inhaled dry powder HCQ up to 20 mg are safe and well tolerated. Our data support that further studies with inhaled HCQ dry powder to evaluate pulmonary pharmacokinetics and efficacy are warranted.</td>

      <td>Association of Higher-Dose Fluoroquinolone Therapy with Serious Adverse Events in Older Adults with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease</td>
      <td>Importance: Population-based data are needed to inform the safe prescribing of fluoroquinolone antibiotics to patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Objective: To quantify the 14-day risk of a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event in patients with advanced CKD newly prescribed a fluoroquinolone at a higher vs a lower dose. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada (January 1, 2008, to March 17, 2020) used linked health care data to identify new users of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Participants included adults 66 years or older with advanced CKD (an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)but not receiving dialysis). Data analysis was performed from January 1 to April 30, 2021. Exposures: A new prescription for a higher-dose fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, 501-1000 mg/d; levofloxacin, 501-750 mg/d; or norfloxacin, 401-800 mg/d) vs a lower-dose fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, 500 mg/d; levofloxacin, 250-500 mg/d; or norfloxacin, 400 mg/d). Main Outcomes and Measure: The primary outcome was the 14-day risk of a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event. Secondary outcomes included a hospital visit with sepsis, retinal detachment or other tendinopathies, all-cause hospitalization, all-cause mortality, and sudden cardiac death. Inverse probability of treatment weighting on the propensity score was used to balance comparison groups on baseline health. Weighted risk ratios and risk differences were obtained using modified Poisson regression and binomial regression, respectively. Results: Of 11917 patients (median age, 83 years [IQR, 77-89 years]; 7438 women [62.4%]; median eGFR, 25 [IQR, 21-28] mL/min/1.73 m(2)) included in the analysis, 5482 (46.0%) received a higher-dose and 6435 (54.0%) received a lower-dose fluoroquinolone. After weighting, the primary composite outcome - a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event - occurred in 68 of 5482 patients (1.2%) treated with a higher-dose fluoroquinolone and in 47 of 5516 (0.9%) treated with a lower-dose fluoroquinolone (weighted risk ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.01-2.08]; weighted risk difference, 0.39% [95% CI, 0.01%-0.76%]). The risk of sepsis, retinal detachment, all-cause hospitalization, all-cause mortality, and sudden cardiac death did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that older patients with advanced CKD who were prescribed a fluoroquinolone at a higher-than-recommended dose were significantly more likely to experience the composite outcome of a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event, although the absolute risk of these events was less than 2%..</td>

      <td>Background: To conduct a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis on the transcriptome signatures of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in pan-cancer. Materials and methods. A total of 11,057 tissues consisting of 33 types of carcinoma in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were retrieved, and then we further explored the correlation between TLRs' expression with tumorigenesis, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity. We conducted a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis on TLR1 to 10 in pan-cancer, including differential expression analysis between normal and tumor tissues, differential immune subtype correlation, survival analysis, tumor immune infiltration estimating, stemness indices correlation, and drug responses correlation. Results: TLR2 was highly expressed in most types of tumors. TLR9 was hardly expressed compared to other TLR genes, which lead to TLR9 showing less correlation with both immune-estimate scores and stromal-estimate scores. All the TLRs were related with immune subtype of tumor samples that all of them were differentially expressed in differential immune subtype samples. The expression of TLRs was positively related with immune-estimate scores and stromal-estimate scores in almost all types of tumor. The expression of TLRs was negatively correlated with mRNA expression-based stemness scores (RNAss) in nearly almost type of tumors except kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and also negatively correlated with DNA methylation-based stemness scores (DNAss) in many types of tumors except adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), KIRC, acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), low-grade glioma (LGG), testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), thymoma (THYM), and uveal melanoma (UVM). The expression of TLR9 was significantly positively correlated with the drug sensitivity of fluphenazine, alectinib, carmustine, and 7-hydroxystaurosporine. TLR7 was significantly positively correlated with the drug sensitivity of alectinib. Conclusions: Our study reveals the significant role of TLRs family in pan-cancer and provides potential therapeutic strategies of cancer.</td>

      <td>Pulmonary Cryptococcosis Diagnosed by Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing in a Young Patient With Normal Immune Function: A Case Report</td>
      <td>Background: Pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) is a serious opportunistic fungal infection that usually occurs in immunocompromised patients. This disease is often difficult to diagnose in time due to its clinical manifestations and radiological feature similar to other pulmonary infections, as well as the low sensitivity of conventional diagnostic methods. Cryptococcosis in immune-competent patients is rare. Case Presentation: Here we report a case of PC in an immune-competent patient. Tuberculosis was suspected according to radiological features due to the positive T-lymphocyte spot test and pure protein derivative skin test. To further detect the pathogen, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). Cryptococcus neoformans (one specific read) was identified by mNGS, indicating the PC of this patient. The following BALF culture and cryptococcal antigen lateral flow assay (CrAg-LFA) test also showed Cryptococcus infection, confirming the mNGS detection. Voriconazole (0.4 g daily) was given orally according to the subsequent susceptibility results. After seven months of treatment, the patient's condition improved. Conclusion: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a better diagnostic tool to help clinicians distinguish pulmonary cryptococcosis from other atypical pulmonary infections.</td>

      <td>Assessment of Bacterial Isolates from the Urine Specimens of Urinary Tract Infected Patient</td>
      <td>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) maintained a serious public health concern, as did the growth in antibiotic resistance both between uropathogenic microorganisms. A regular assessment of the microbiological agents that cause UTIs, as well as their antimicrobial resistance, is essential for a tailored empirical antibiotic response. Knowing the variables that cause UTIs can help you intervene quickly and simply to get the condition under control. The most common infecting species in acute infection is Escherichia coli (E. coli). To strengthen infection control strategies, it is necessary to know the prevalence and location of UTI. The goal of this research is to measure the frequency of microorganisms isolated from patients with UTIs as well as the antimicrobial sensitivity characteristics of Gram-negative bacteria. The purpose of this research has been to evaluate the frequency of UTIs by extracting and characterizing the various bacterial etiological organisms, as well as to assess the factors linked to UTIs. The goal of this research is to identify, characterize, and establish the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacteria linked to urinary tract infections. Fresh collected urine specimen was taken from inpatients or outpatients in UTI cases and bacteriologically tested using conventional microbiological methods. The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was used to create the antibiogram. Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus aureus (28%), and Escherichia coli (24.6%) were the most common isolates (20%). The evaluated agents' antibacterial activity was all in the following order: cefixime, ciprofloxacin, augmentin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, nitrofurantoin, ofloxacin, and cefuroxime. It was discovered that each and every one of the microbes exhibited varied degrees of resistance to the antibiotics nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin. Every type of bacteria, with the exception of those belonging to the genus Streptococcus, has a Multiple Antibiotic Resistance Index (MARI) that is more than 0.2. The first-line therapies for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the region would consist of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin. Lower urinary tract infections almost never result in problems if they are diagnosed and treated as soon as possible and in the correct manner. However, if treatment is not sought, a urinary tract infection can lead to serious complications.</td>

      <td>Tetracycline (TC) is widely-used antibiotic pollutant with high toxicity, refractory, persistence and bacteriostasis, and its removal from water needs to be enhanced. In this work, a novel Graphite-UiO-66(Zr)/Ti electrode was successfully prepared and evaluated for electrochemical oxidation degradation of TC. The electrochemical performance tests indicate the Graphite-UiO-66(Zr)/Ti electrode had higher electrochemical oxidation activity, which achieved higher TC removal efficiency (98.1% ± 1.5%) than Ti plate (65.2% ± 3.5%), Graphite-MIL-53(Al)/Ti electrode (79.5% ± 2.9%) and Graphite-MIL-100(Fe)/Ti electrode (89.0% ± 2.6%). The influence of operating condition was also systematically studied, and the optimized condition was pH 5.0, 20 mA/cm2 current density and 0.1 M electrolyte (Na2SO4). Through the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), the TC degradation pathway by Graphite-UiO-66(Zr)/Ti electrode oxidation was proposed. Under the •OH free radical oxidative decomposition effect, the double bond, phenolic group and amine group of TC were attacked. TC was transformed into intermediate product ① (m/z = 447), then was further degraded to intermediates ② (m/z = 401) and ③ (m/z = 417). The latter was fragmented into small fractions ④ (m/z = 194), ⑤but-2-enedioic acid (m/z = 116) and ⑥oxalic acid (m/z = 90, the proposed intermediate). In addition, TC removal remained at 89.6% ± 2.7% in the sixth cycle of operation, which confirmed the efficient reusability and stability for antibiotics removal from water.</td>

      <td>Antipsychotics for agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia</td>
      <td>Background: Typical and atypical antipsychotics are widely used to treat agitation and psychosis in dementia. However, whether or not they are beneficial is uncertain. Some trials have yielded negative results and effectiveness may be outweighed by harms. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Search methods: We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid Sp), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta-register, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 7 January 2021. Two review authors independently screened the title and abstract of the hits, and two review authors assessed the full text of studies that got through this screening. Selection criteria: We included randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trials comparing the effects of antipsychotics and placebo for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, or both, irrespective of age, severity of cognitive impairment, and setting. (The majority of) participants had to have clinically significant agitation (including aggression) or psychosis or both at baseline. We excluded studies about antipsychotics that are no longer available in the USA or EU, or that are used for emergency short-term sedation. We also excluded head-to-head trials and antipsychotic withdrawal trials. Data collection and analysis: The primary outcomes were (1) reduction in agitation or psychosis in participants with agitation or psychosis, respectively at baseline, and (2) the number of participants with adverse events: somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, any adverse event, any serious adverse event (SAE), and death. Two review authors independently extracted the necessary data and assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated the pooled effect on agitation and psychosis for typical and atypical antipsychotics separately, and the pooled risk of adverse effects independent of the target symptom (agitation or psychosis). We used RevMan Web for the analyses. Main results: The search yielded 8233 separate hits. After assessing the full-text of 35 studies, we included 24 trials that met the eligibility criteria. Six trials tested a typical antipsychotic, four for agitation and two for psychosis. Twenty trials tested an atypical antipsychotic, eight for agitation and 12 for psychosis. Two trials tested both drug types. Seventeen of 26 comparisons were performed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease specifically. The other nine comparisons also included patients with vascular dementia or mixed dementia. Together, the studies included 6090 participants (12 to 652 per study). The trials were performed in institutionalised, hospitalised and community-dwelling patients, or a combination of those. For typical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, thiothixene), we are uncertain whether these drugs improve agitation compared with placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.57 to -0.15, 4 studies, n = 361); very low-certainty evidence, but typical antipsychotics may improve psychosis slightly (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.03, 2studies, n= 240; low-certainty evidence) compared with placebo. These drugs probably increase the risk of somnolence (risk ratio (RR) 2.62, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.56, 3 studies, n = 466; moderate-certainty evidence) and increase extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.23, 3 studies, n = 467; high-certainty) evidence. There was no evidence regarding the risk of any adverse event. The risks of SAEs (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.66, 1 study, n = 193) and death (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.00, 6 studies, n = 578) may be increased slightly, but these estimates were very imprecise, and the certainty was low. The effect estimates for haloperidol from five trials were in line with those of the drug class. Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) probably reduce agitation slightly (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.12, 7 studies, n = 1971; moderate-certainty evidence), but probably have a negligible effect on psychosis (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.03, 12 studies, n = 3364; moderate-certainty evidence). These drugs increase the risk of somnolence (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.39, 13 studies, n - 3878; high-certainty evidence) and are probably also associated with slightly increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.68, 15 studies, n = 4180; moderate-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.61, 15 studies, n= 4316; moderate-certainty evidence) and death (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.05, 17 studies, n= 5032; moderate-certainty evidence), although the latter estimate was imprecise. The drugs probably have a negligible effect on the risk of any adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09, 11 studies, n = 2785; moderate-certainty evidence). The findings from seven trials for risperidone were in line with those for the drug class. Authors' conclusions: There is some evidence that typical antipsychotics might decrease agitation and psychosis slightly in patients with dementia. Atypical antipsychotics reduce agitation in dementia slightly, but their effect on psychosis in dementia is negligible. The apparent effectiveness of the drugs seen in daily practice may be explained by a favourable natural course of the symptoms, as observed in the placebo groups. Both drug classes increase the risk of somnolence and other adverse events. If antipsychotics are considered for sedation in patients with severe and dangerous symptoms, this should be discussed openly with the patient and legal representative.</td>

      <td>Differences in Endothelial Activation and Dysfunction Induced by Antiphospholipid Antibodies Among Groups of Patients With Thrombotic, Refractory, and Non-refractory Antiphospholipid Syndrome</td>
      <td>Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by pregnancy morbidity or thrombosis and persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) that bind to the endothelium and induce endothelial activation, which is evidenced by the expression of adhesion molecules and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent endothelial dysfunction marked by a decrease in the synthesis and release of nitric oxide (NO). These endothelial alterations are the key components for the development of severe pathological processes in APS. Patients with APS can be grouped according to the presence of other autoimmune diseases (secondary APS), thrombosis alone (thrombotic APS), pregnancy morbidity (obstetric APS), and refractoriness to conventional treatment regimens (refractory APS). Typically, patients with severe and refractory obstetric APS exhibit thrombosis and are classified as those having primary or secondary APS. The elucidation of the mechanisms underlying these alterations according to the different groups of patients with APS could help establish new therapies, particularly necessary for severe and refractory cases. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the differences in endothelial activation and dysfunction induced by aPL between patients with refractory obstetric APS and other APS clinical manifestations. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated with polyclonal immunoglobulin-G (IgG) from different groups of patients n = 21), including those with primary (VTI) and secondary thrombotic APS (VTII) and refractory primary (RI+), refractory secondary (RII+), and non-refractory primary (NR+) obstetric APS. All of them with thrombosis. The expression of adhesion molecules; the production of ROS, NO, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and endothelin-1; and the generation of microparticles were used to evaluate endothelial activation and dysfunction. VTI IgG induced the expression of adhesion molecules and the generation of microparticles and VEGF. RI+ IgG induced the expression of adhesion molecules and decreased NO production. RII+ IgG increased the production of microparticles, ROS, and endothelin-1 and reduced NO release. NR+ IgG increased the production of microparticles and endothelin-1 and decreased the production of VEGF and NO. These findings reveal differences in endothelial activation and dysfunction among groups of patients with APS, which should be considered in future studies to evaluate new therapies, especially in refractory cases.</td>

      <td>Intrapleural treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with malignant pleural effusions in the real world</td>
      <td>Background: The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy and side-effects of intrapleural treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPEs). Methods: The medical records of NSCLC patients with MPEs diagnosed in four Chinese hospitals from October 2014 to December 2019 were searched. The Kaplan–Meier method is used to calculate median overall survival (MOS) and subgroup analyses are done. Results: A total of 285 patients were evaluated; 81.1% of patients received intrapleural treatment, and no patients received talc pleurodesis. MOS of the whole cohort was 21 months. Patients were divided into three groups: erythromycin group (EG; intrapleural treatment with drugs and erythromycin); intrathoracic treatment group (ITG; intrapleural treatment with drugs); control group (CG; no drug treatment in the pleural cavity). The MOS of patients in the EG, ITG and CG was 20, 22, and 19 months, respectively. Among patients who received only chemotherapy as systemic therapy, the MOS of intrathoracic administration group (IAG; i.e., EG and ITG) was longer than that of CG (12 vs. 6 months; p = 0.034), and the MOS of patients with a ratio of carcinoembryonic antigen in pleural effusion (PE-CEA): CEA in blood (B-CEA) ≤1 is worse than that of patients with a ratio &gt;1 (4 vs. 12 months, p = 0.021) and that of CG (4 vs. 6 months, p = 0.442). Conclusions: Intrapleural treatment can prolong the survival of NSCLC patients with MPE who do not receive targeted treatment or who only receive chemotherapy. The PE-CEA: B-CEA ratio can be used to predict the efficacy if intrapleural treatment is indicated.</td>

Brain magnetic resonance imaging studies (MRIs) revealed multiple rim-enhancing brain lesions bilaterally. An extensive clinical and laboratory workup was unrevealing, and 2 brain biopsies were initially considered inconclusive. Pertinently, no systemic lymphoproliferative disorder was identified. The patient initially experienced remarkable clinical improvement with dexamethasone, pulse methylprednisolone, and rituximab therapy. However, he eventually had rapid clinical deterioration, was found to have increased brain lesions, and died nearly 6 months after the initial presentation. During this time, the second brain biopsy was found to show involvement by T-cell lymphoma of NK-cell lineage, which was EBV negative. No post-mortem examination was done to identify any systemic lymphoma. This case serves to expand the spectrum of lymphomas involving the CNS.</td>

      <td>Background: Ochrobactrum spp. are non-fermenting, Gram-negative bacilli that are regarded as emerging human pathogens of low virulence that can cause infections. The first identified case of Ochrobactrum intermedium was reported in 1998 in a liver transplantation patient with liver abcess. There are no reports of infections in pediatric patients. Here, we report the first case of O. intermedium bacteremia in a pediatric patient. Case presentation: A two and a half years old male was admitted with fever, chills and nausea. He had been diagnosed as pineoblastoma and underwent surgical resection and chemotherapy. O. intermedium was isolated from his blood cultures and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), however, the Vitek II automated system failed to identify the organism. Then the pathogen was confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing and average nucleotide identity result (ANI) confirmed the precise identification of O. intermedium at genomic level. In addition, the patient recovered well after antibiotic combined therapy. Conclusions: This, to our knowledge, is the first case of O. intermedium bacteremia in a pediatric patient with malignant tumor. Traditional biochemical identification methods such as API 20NE or VITEK2 system cannot differentiate O. anthropi and O. intermedium. MALDI-TOF may be a promising tool for rapid identification of microorganisms such as O. intermedium.</td>

      <td>Temporal evolution of the resistance genotypes of Plasmodium falciparum in isolates from Equatorial Guinea during 20 years (1999 to 2019)</td>
      <td>Background: Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, particularly in Africa. As such, resistance to anti-malarial drugs is one of the most important problems in terms of global malaria control. This study assesses the evolution of the different resistance markers over time and the possible influence of interventions and treatment changes that have been made in Equatorial Guinea. Methods: A total of 1223 biological samples obtained in the period 1999 to 2019 were included in the study. Screening for mutations in the pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmdr1, and pfcrt genes was carried out by nested PCR and restriction-fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), and the study of pfk13 genes was carried out by nested PCR, followed by sequencing to determine the presence of mutations. Results: The partially and fully resistant haplotypes (pfdhfr + pfdhps) were found to increase over time. Moreover, in 2019, the fully resistant haplotype was found to be increasing, although its super-resistant counterpart remains much less prevalent. A continued decline in pfmdr1 and pfcrt gene mutations over time was also found. The number of mutations detected in pfk13 has increased since 2008, when artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) were first introduced, with more mutations being observed in 2019, with two synonymous and five non-synonymous mutations being detected, although these are not related to resistance to ACT. In addition, the non-synonymous A578S mutation, which is the most frequent on the African continent, was detected in 2013, although not in the following years. Conclusions: Withdrawal of the use of chloroquine (CQ) as a treatment in Equatorial Guinea has been shown to be effective over time, as wild-type parasite populations outnumber mutant populations. The upward trend observed in sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance markers suggest its misuse, either alone or in combination with artesunate (AS) or amodiaquine (AQ), in some areas of the country, as was found in a previous study conducted by this group, which allows selective pressure from SP to continue. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 540E and 581G do not exceed the limit of 50 and 10%, respectively, thus meaning that SP is still effective as an intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) in this country. As for the pfk13 gene, no mutations have been detected in relation to resistance to ACT. However, in 2019 there is a greater accumulation of non-synonymous mutations compared to years prior to 2008.

Immediately after removing the bronchial casts, their dyspnea symptoms improved significantly, and they recovered after comprehensive treatment with antiviral drugs, antibiotics and glucocorticoids. When children with asthma have acute progressive and difficult-to-relieve dyspnea after infection with influenza A virus, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of PB and perform bronchoscopy as soon as possible to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment and improve patient prognosis.</td>

      <td>Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome is an umbrella term covering a constellation of bone lesions and skin manifestations, but has rarely been clarified in the clinic. We report a 28-year-old woman who had initial onset of SAPHO syndrome with involvement of the femur, and she experienced a tortuous diagnostic course. We also performed a literature review of SAPHO syndrome cases involving the femur and summarize several empirical conclusions by integrating previous findings with our case. Furthermore, we propose our perspective that ailment of the skin caused by infection of pathogens might be the first hit for triggering or perpetuating the activation of the immune system. As a result, musculoskeletal manifestations are probably the second hit by crosstalk of an autoimmune reaction. The skin manifestations preceding bone lesions can be well explained. Current interventions for SAPHO syndrome remain controversial, but drugs aiming at symptom relief could serve as the first preference for treatment. An accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment can cure patients in a timely manner. Although the pathogenesis of SAPHO syndrome remains to be determined, physicians and surgeons still need to heighten awareness of this entity to avoid invasive procedures, such as frequent biopsies or nonessential ostectomy.</td>

Pulmonary fungal balls caused by Trichophyton are extremely rare. A 65-year-old man who worked in a leather recycling factory was admitted because of a productive cough and shortness of breath. He had a history of tuberculosis with lung destruction. A chest radiograph showed an opacity surrounding an air lucency over the left lung field, and chest computed tomography showed a mass within a cavity, producing a ball-in-hole appearance, over the left upper lung lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, and fungal culture of the lavage fluid yielded Trichophyton. After 6 months of treatment with oral itraconazole, the patient’s general condition improved. This case emphasizes the importance of awareness of fungal infection within cavitary lesions of the lung and shows that Trichophyton may be the etiologic organism in such cases.

      <td>Cold sores are nasolabial blisters caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. Novel therapies demonstrating simultaneously antiviral activity and improved wound healing are war-ranted. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of medical-grade honey (MGH) for treating HSV-induced cold sores. A crossover trial was performed in patients with recurrent cold sores (n = 29). The majority (65.6%) of these patients experience four or more episodes per year, thus forming a valid self-control group. In this study, patients applied an MGH-based formulation (L-Mesitran Soft) on their cold sore at the onset of symptoms (62.1%) or appearing of blister (37.9%) and compared it to their conventional treatments. After complete healing, patients filled in a ques-tionnaire evaluating healing, pain, and itching. The average absolute healing time was 72.4% slower with conventional treatment (10.0 days) compared to MGH (5.8 days). After MGH treatment, 86.2% of all patients experienced faster objective healing (6.9% similar and 6.9% slower) and the subjective healing score was higher in 79.3% of the patients (20.7% similar). If the patients normally experience pain and itching during their cold sores, these levels were lower with MGH therapy compared to conventional treatment in 72.7% and 71.4% of the patients, respectively. Moreover, 100% of the patients prefer MGH treatment over conventional treatment and will use it again on future cold sores. MGH is a promising alternative treatment for cold sores, likely by combining both increased antiviral and wound healing activities while alleviating pain and itching.</td>

      <td>Context: Human embryonic implantation is regulated by neuroendocrine hormones, ovarian steroids, growth factors, and cytokines. Sympathetic innervation of the uterus also may play a role. Objective: We tested the hypothesis that cabergoline (Cb), an agonist of type 2 dopamine receptors (DRD2), could influence endometrial decidualization in vitro. Methods: Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of catecholaminergic neurons in human uterine tissue. DRD2 mRNA and protein expression in endometrial tissue and cells were validated by quantitative RT-PCR, cDNA microarrays, RNA sequencing, and Western blotting. Isolated human endometrial stromal cells (ESC) were subjected to dose-response and time-course experiments in the absence or presence of decidualizing hormones (10 nM estradiol, 100 nM progesterone, and 0.5 mM dibutyryl cAMP). In some cases, interleukin (IL)-1β (0.1 nM) was used as an inflammatory stimulus. Well-characterized in vitro biomarkers were quantified. Results: DRD2 were maximally expressed in vivo in the mid-secretory phase of the cycle and upregulated in ESC in response to decidualizing hormones, as were classical (eg, prolactin) and emerging (eg, VEGF and connexin 43) differentiation biomarkers. Cabergoline treatment more than doubled decidual biomarker expression, whereas risperidone, a dopamine receptor antagonist, inhibited ESC differentiation by &gt;50%. Cabergoline induced characteristic decidual morphology changes and blocked detrimental effects of IL-1β on decidual cytology. Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that dopaminergic neurons modulate decidualization in situ. We postulate that dopamine agonists, like Cb, could be developed as therapeutic agents to enhance implantation in couples with inflammation-associated infertility.</td>

In this study, phenotypic and genotypic resistance profiles of 35 [n=18 E. faecium (Efm); n=17 E. faecalis (Efs)] invasive isolates cultured from hospitalized patients were analysed. Phenotypic identification was verified by the multiplex PCR targeting the 16S rDNA and the ddl genes encoding for the Efs and Efm - specific ligases. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using the disc diffusion method and E-tests. The high-level streptomycin resistance (HLSR), high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) and glycopeptide resistance was verified by amplification of the ant(6)-Ia, aac(6')-Ie-aph(2")-Ia, as well as vanA and vanB genes, respectively. More than 70% of all isolates were cultured from patients in the Intensive Care and Internal Medicine Units. Blood was the predominant (77%) site of isolation. All Efm isolates were resistant to ampicillin, imipenem, and norfloxacin; 17 isolates demonstrated high-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR), including 27.7% with HLSR, 38.8% with HLGR and 27.7% with both phenotypes. HLAR was also common in Efs (HLSR&gt;70%, HLGR&gt;50%), followed by norfloxacin (64.7%) and ampicillin (11.7%) resistance. The ant(6)-Ia and aac(6')-Ie-aph(2")-Ia genes were detected in &gt;90% of the HLSR and HLGR isolates, respectively. Glycopeptide resistance was detected in 4 (22.2%) Efm isolates and mediated by the vanA gene. 19 (54.3%) isolates were multidrug resistant, including 17 (89.5%) Efm. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid. The study constitutes a contribution to the analysis of enterococcal antimicrobial resistance in Polish hospitals.

However, there are still uncertainties about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in individuals with chronic liver disease. Case Presentation: Three patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection presented to our hospital with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) due to HBV flare after COVID-19 vaccination (mRNA-1273 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19). Their COVID-19 antibodies were tested by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay, which showed good response after full two-dose course of vaccine. One patient refused the test. The patients’ clinical conditions deteriorated during hospitalization. Patient 1 received Entecavir (Baraclude) 1 mg/day upon presentation, but the serum bilirubin level and international normalized ratio (INR) kept increasing. He was comatose in one week and underwent urgent living donor liver transplantation. Patient 2 was on regular Entecavir (Baraclude) 0.5 mg/day and was increased to 1 mg/day upon admission. The serum bilirubin level and INR kept increasing, and he developed grade 3 hepatic encephalopathy in three weeks. The patient then received urgent living donor liver transplantation. Patient 3 received Entecavir (Baraclude) 1 mg/day upon presentation. Her serum bilirubin and INR kept increasing, and her mental status altered in a week. She did not undergo liver transplantation for her old age. Conclusions: It is not still unclear whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and HBV infection flare. Furthermore, the mechanism of COVID-19 vaccine-induced HBV reactivation is not established. Further studies are needed in this regard. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, prophylactic antiviral therapy for HBV infection before COVID-19 vaccination should be considered.</td>

Materials and Methods: From August 2016 to February 2018, 806 consecutive patients who had undergone the first-stage PCNL with negative urine culture were included. Preoperative urinalysis, antibiotic treatment, intraoperative stone culture, and postoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) were prospectively recorded. The primary outcome was SIRS. The impact of preoperative antibiotics on preoperative UTI, stone culture, and postoperative SIRS was studied. Results: Among the 806 participants, the rate of positive urine dipstick infection test and SIRS were 26.8% and 7.2%, respectively. In univariable analysis, positive urinary nitrite (p &lt; 0.001), positive urinary leukocytes (p &lt; 0.001), positive urine dipstick infection test (p &lt; 0.001), longer duration of pre-PCNL antibiotics (p = 0.001), higher level of pre-PCNL antibiotics (p = 0.010), infection stones (p = 0.001), and positive stone culture (p &lt; 0.001) were risk factors for SIRS. However, multivariable analysis showed that positive stone culture (p = 0.004) and prolonged preoperative treatment with antibiotics (p = 0.021) were independent risk factors for SIRS. Although preoperative antibiotics reduced the incidence of positive urine leukocyte (p &lt; 0.001) or nitrite reactions (p &lt; 0.001), prolonged or upgraded preoperative antibiotics did not affect the incidence of positive stone culture. Whether stone culture was positive (p = 0.023) or negative (p = 0.025), prolonged preoperative treatment with antibiotics was associated with a higher incidence of SIRS. Conclusions: Enhanced preoperative antibiotic treatment based on positive urine dipstick infection tests was insufficient to reduce the incidence of positive stone culture but increased the risk of SIRS after PCNL in patients with negative urine cultures.</td>

      <td>Guided by Global Natural Products Social molecular networking, two p-terphenyl derivatives and one 4,5-diphenyl-2-pyrone analogue, peniterphenyls A-C (1-3), together with five known p-terphenyl derivatives (4-8) and sulochrin (9), were obtained from a deep-sea-derived Penicillium sp. SCSIO41030. Their structures were elucidated using extensive NMR spectroscopic and HRESIMS data and by comparing the information with literature data. Peniterphenyl B (2) represented the first reported natural product possessing a 4,5-diphenyl-substituted 2-pyrone derivative. The p-terphenyl derivatives displayed inhibitory activities against HSV-1/2 with EC50 values ranging from 1.4 ± 0.6 to 9.3 ± 3.7 μM in Vero cells, which showed that they possessed antiviral activities with low cytotoxicity, superior to the current clinical drug acyclovir (EC50 3.6 ± 0.7 μM). Peniterphenyl A (1) inhibited HSV-1/2 virus entry into cells and may block HSV-1/2 infection through direct interaction with virus envelope glycoprotein D to interfere with virus adsorption and membrane fusion, and thus differs from the nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir. Our study indicated peniterphenyl A (1) could be a promising lead compound against HSV-1/2.</td>

      <td>Background: The role of microbiota in biliary atresia (BA) remains unclear. The aim of our study was to assess efficacy and safety of LGG treatment in children with BA after HPE with special focus on bacterial cholangitis (BCH) and quantitative assessment of the gut microbiota composition and metabolism. Methods: We performed double-blind placebo controlled trial with patients randomized into treatment group who received LGG (n = 14) and placebo (n = 16). The gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were assessed at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Clinical and laboratory parameters including episodes of bacterial cholangitis (BCH) were collected during the study period and after 2-year follow-up. Additionally, stool composition of BA patients was compared with healthy age-matched control group. Results: There were lower concentration of SCFA in children with BA compared to control group and significant increase in the number of Enterococcus bacteria. After 6 months of treatment, neither laboratory parameters nor gut microbiota composition differed between LGG group and placebo. PP analysis results were similar to ITT analysis, no significant differences between study and control group. Overall, there were 11 (36%) patients who developed at least one episode of bacterial cholangitis; 3 (21%) in the LGG group compared to 8 (50%) placebo group (p = 0.14). Bacterial cultures were positive in 22% of cases and recurrence after the first episode was observed in 27% of patients. The level of total bilirubin decreased below 2 mg/dl after 6 months of the study in 6 (42.8%) patients in the LGG group and in 8 (50%) patients in the placebo group (p = 0.73). During 2-year follow-up 6 out of 14 patients (42.8%) in the LGG group and 11 out of 16 placebo patients (68.7%) underwent liver transplantation (p = 0.27). Conclusions: Patients with BA present with specific microbiota profiles and decreased SCFA what gives opportunities to implement novel therapeutic options based on modulation of microbiota. Whether LGG is an effective therapy needs to be studied in a larger group with similar outcome parameters.</td>

      <td>Background: We investigated the association between socioclinical, inflammatory, and metabolic markers and weight gain in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Methods: Individuals from the COPANA cohort of normal weight (body mass index [BMI], 18.5-24.9 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) at cART initiation who achieved virological suppression (viral load, &lt;50 copies/mL) and maintained it through 36 months of treatment were selected. Clinical, immunovirological, and socioeconomic data and inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, CXCL10, CXCL8, interleukin 6, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors 1 and 2, soluble CD14, and soluble CD16) and serum metabolic (glucose, insulin, lipid profile, adiponectin, and leptin) markers were assessed. Factors associated with becoming overweight (BMI, 25-29.9) or obese (BMI, ≥30) at 36 months were assessed using multivariate logistic regression models. Results: After 36 months of cART, 32 of 158 people with HIV (20%) became overweight or obese (21% female; 65% born in France and 23% born in sub-Saharan Africa; median BMI at cART initiation, 22 [interquartile range, 21-23]). After adjustment, higher BMI, originating from sub-Saharan Africa, living in a couple, and higher soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 and lower adiponectin concentrations at cART initiation were associated with becoming overweight or obese. Conclusion: Weight gain on cART is multifactorial. Special attention should be given to migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. Monocyte activation and adipocyte dysfunction at cART initiation affect weight regulation.</td>

      <td>Background: The HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 083 trial demonstrated that long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA) was more effective than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men. We characterized HIV infections that occurred in the blinded phase of HPTN 083. Methods: Retrospective testing included HIV testing, viral load testing, quantification of study drugs, and HIV drug resistance testing. Results: Fifty-eight infections were evaluated, including 51 incident infections (12 in CAB arm and 39 in TDF/FTC arm). In many cases (5 in CAB arm and 37 in TDF/FTC arm), infection was associated with low or unquantifiable study drug concentrations. In 4 cases, infection occurred with on-time CAB-LA injections and expected plasma CAB concentrations. CAB exposure was associated with prolonged viral suppression and delayed antibody expression. In some cases, delayed HIV diagnosis resulted in CAB provision to participants with undetected infection, delayed antiretroviral therapy, and emergence of drug resistance; most of these infections would have been detected earlier with viral load testing. Conclusions: Early detection of HIV infection and prompt antiretroviral therapy initiation could improve clinical outcomes in persons who become infected despite CAB-LA prophylaxis. Further studies are needed to elucidate the correlates of HIV protection in persons receiving CAB-LA.</td>

      <td>Diminished Circulating Levels of Angiogenic Factors and Rage Ligands in Helminth-Diabetes Comorbidity and Reversal following Anthelmintic Treatment</td>
      <td>Background: Various epidemiological and experimental studies propose that helminths could play a preventive role against the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM induces microvascular and large vessel complications mediated by elevated levels of angiogenic factors and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) ligands. However, the interactions between helminths and host angiogenic factors and RAGE ligands are unexplored. Methods: To assess the relationship between a soil-transmitted helminth, Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss), and T2DM, we measured plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, -C, and -D; angiopoietins 1 and 2 (Ang-1 and Ang-2); and their receptors VEGF-R1, -R2, and -R3 as well as soluble RAGE (sRAGE) and their ligands advanced glycation end products (AGEs), S100A12, and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) in individuals with T2DM with or those without Ss infection. In Ss-infected individuals, we also measured the levels of aforementioned factors 6 months following anthelmintic therapy. Results: Ss-infected individuals exhibited significantly decreased levels of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, Ang-1, and Ang-2 and their soluble receptors VEGF-R1, -R2, and -R3, that increased following anthelmintic therapy. Likewise, Ss-infected individuals exhibited significantly decreased levels of AGEs and their ligands sRAGE, S100A12, and HMGB-1, which reversed following anthelmintic therapy. Conclusions: Our data suggest that Ss infection could play a beneficial role by limiting or delaying T2DM-related vascular complications.</td>

To help address this knowledge gap we reviewed our experience with MH for UTI prophylaxis, focusing on women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs.Methods:The University of Kentucky electronic health record was queried to identify adults who were prescribed MH from the urology clinic between January 2013 and January 2019. Charts were reviewed to assess patient-reported UTI frequency, demographics and relevant health factors. Treatment success was defined as 0-1 UTI in 6 months or 0-2 UTIs in 1 year.Results:Of 670 patients prescribed MH, 508 did not meet inclusion criteria. The most common reasons for exclusion were complicated UTI, no return visit, treatment nonadherence and insufficient followup time. The primary study population was 162 women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs: 41 premenopausal and 121 postmenopausal. Success rates with MH were 83% and 77%, respectively. Success rates were not significantly associated with age, diabetes, immune suppression, high-tone pelvic floor dysfunction or (if postmenopausal) vaginal estrogen use. Exploratory study of patients using intermittent catheterization showed success in 20 of 30 patients (67%).Conclusions:MH had high success rates for premenopausal and postmenopausal women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs. Patients using catheters had lower success rates. Prospective trials would strengthen the evidence to guide decisions for treatment and insurance coverage.</td>

      <td>Haemophilus influenzae is a common cause of mucosal infections that warrants accurate surveillance. We aimed to assess the prevalence of the species in clinical specimens, and characterise population structure and resistance to aminopenicillins by whole genome sequencing.We assessed the point prevalence by entering the database records of 1 day in Denmark and examined the genome sequences of nationwide, collected isolates from the same day. The prevalence of H. influenzae in clinical samples on the 10th of January 2018 was 1.78 per 100,000 person-days (all samples), and 2.47 per 1000 hospital bed-days (hospital samples). Of 2009 bacteria deemed clinically relevant and collected in a concerted action by the Danish departments of clinical microbiology, 62 (3.1%) were H. influenzae. All 62 isolates belonged to phylogenetic group I and were unencapsulated. Three strains from separate Danish regions had identical core genome sequences, but a small number of intergenic mutations testified to circulating clones, rather than individual cases of patient-to-patient transmission. The TEM-1 β-lactamase gene was present in 24 strains, while 13 strains were genetically categorised as ampicillin-resistant due to substitutions in penicillin-binding protein 3; shared patterns of amino acid substitutions in unrelated strains indicated putative lateral transfer of chromosomal resistance. Circulating clones of H. influenzae are frequent, and host factors, rather than direct transmission of epidemic strains, may be the primary cause of infection. The bleak presence of ampicillin resistance revealed by sequencing of point prevalence strains underscores the necessity for close examination of testing methods.</td>

      <td>Background. Current guidelines recommend community-wide mass azithromycin for trachoma, but a targeted treatment strategy could reduce the volume of antibiotics required. Methods. In total, 48 Ethiopian communities were randomized to mass, targeted, or delayed azithromycin distributions. In the targeted arm, only children aged 6 months to 5 years with evidence of ocular chlamydia received azithromycin, distributed thrice over the following year. The primary outcome was ocular chlamydia at months 12 and 24, comparing the targeted and delayed arms (0-5 year-olds, superiority analysis) and the targeted and mass azithromycin arms (8-12 year-olds, noninferiority analysis, 10% noninferiority margin). Results. At baseline, the mean prevalence of ocular chlamydia in the 3 arms ranged from 7% to 9% among 0-5 year-olds and from 3% to 9% among 8-12 year-olds. Averaged across months 12-24, the mean prevalence of ocular chlamydia among 0-5 yearolds was 16.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.0%-24.4%) in the targeted arm and 22.3% (95% CI: 11.1%-33.6%) in the delayed arm (P = .61). The final mean prevalence of ocular chlamydia among 8-12 year-olds was 13.5% (95% CI: 7.9%-19.1%) in the targeted arm and 5.5% (95% CI: 0.3%-10.7%) in the mass treatment arm (adjusted risk difference 8.5 percentage points [pp] higher in the targeted arm, 95% CI: 0.9 pp-16.1 pp higher). Conclusions. Antibiotic treatments targeted to infected preschool children did not result in significantly less ocular chlamydia infections compared with untreated communities and did not meet noninferiority criteria relative to mass azithromycin distributions. Targeted approaches may require treatment of a broader segment of the population in areas with hyperendemic trachoma.</td>

      <td>Background. Bancroftian filariasis remains endemic in Fiji despite &gt;10 years of mass drug administration (MDA) using diethylcarbamazine and albendazole (DA). The addition of ivermectin to this combination (IDA) has improved efficacy of microfilarial clearance at 12 months in individually randomized trials in nocturnal transmission settings, but impact in a setting of diurnally subperiodic filarial transmission has not been evaluated. Methods. This cluster randomized study compared the individual efficacy and community impact of IDA vs DA as MDA for lymphatic filariasis in 35 villages on 2 islands of Fiji. Participants were tested at enrollment for circulating filarial antigen and, if positive, for microfilariae. Weight-dosed treatment was offered according to village randomization. Communities were visited at 12 months and retested for lymphatic filariasis. Infected individuals from Rotuma were retested at 24 months. Results. A total of 3816 participants were enrolled and 3616 were treated. At 12 months, microfilariae clearance was achieved in 72 of 111 participants detected with infection at baseline, with no difference in efficacy between treatment groups: DA, 69.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57.2%-79.1%) vs IDA, 62.5% (95% CI, 43.6%-78.2%); risk difference, 11.3 % (95% CI, -10% to 32.7%); P = .30. There was no difference between treatment groups in community prevalence of microfilariae at 12 months or individual clearance at 24 months. Conclusions. We found no difference between IDA and DA in individual clearance or community prevalence of lymphatic filariasis at 12 months, and no improved efficacy following a second annual round of IDA. Possible explanations for the apparent lack of benefit of IDA compared to DA include drug and parasite factors affecting clearance, and higher than expected reinfection rates.</td>

      <td>Background. Management of acute, uncomplicated cystitis in outpatients benefits from knowledge of drug resistance patterns in the population. However, antibiograms are often not available for the outpatient setting, and the role of host factors such as sex and age in assessing the likelihood of resistance are not well understood. We investigated whether antibiotic resistance patterns of outpatient urinary Escherichia coli isolates vary by age group and sex in a large database of antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) results from Washington State. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed AST data for outpatient urinary E. coli isolates in Washington State tested at a clinical reference laboratory from 2013 to 2017. In logistic regression models stratified by sex, we tested the associations of antibiotic resistance with patient age. Results. We found females &gt;50 years had greater odds than females younger than 19 for resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-1.69), ciprofloxacin (OR, 3.04; 95% CI, 2.48-3.74), ceftriaxone (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.77-3.92), and gentamicin (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.27-2.08) (all P &lt; .001). Compared to males younger than 19, males &gt;50 years had greater odds of resistance to ciprofloxacin (OR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.18-5.69) and lower odds of resistance to amoxicillinclavulanate (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, .34-.96) (all P &lt; .05). Conclusions. These findings demonstrate that age and sex are associated with variability in antibiotic resistance patterns in the outpatient setting. Availability of outpatient antibiotic resistance data based on sex and age may be useful to inform empiric prescribing for outpatient UTIs and to support antibiotic stewardship efforts.</td>

The preventive effect of co-trimoxazole on the primary endpoint was 22% (95% CI: -14%- 47%; P = .20) versus no prophylaxis and 25% (-10%-48%; P = .14) versus chloroquine. When WHO HIV/AIDS stage 2 events were added to the primary endpoint, preventive effect increased to 31% (3-51%; P = .032) and 32% (4-51%; P = .026), respectively. Co-trimoxazole and chloroquine prophylaxis effectively prevented clinical malaria episodes (3.8 and 3.0, respectively, vs 28/100 person-years; P &lt; .001). Conclusions. Malawian adults with HIV who immune reconstituted on ART and continued co-trimoxazole prophylaxis experienced fewer deaths and WHO HIV/AIDS stage 3-4 events compared with prophylaxis discontinuation, although statistical significance was not achieved. Co-trimoxazole prevented a composite of death plus WHO HIV/AIDS stage 2-4 events. Given poor healthcare access and lack of routine viral load monitoring, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis should continue in adults on ART after immune reconstitution in sub-Saharan Africa.

      <td>Sera Neutralizing Activities Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and Multiple Variants 6 Months After Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019</td>
      <td>Background. Humoral response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs within the first weeks after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Those antibodies exert a neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2, whose evolution over time after COVID-19 as well as efficiency against novel variants are poorly characterized. Methods. In this prospective study, sera of 107 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were collected at 3 and 6 months postinfection. We performed quantitative neutralization experiments on top of high-throughput serological assays evaluating antispike (S) and anti-nucleocapsid (NP) immunoglobulin G (IgG). Results. Levels of seroneutralization and IgG rates against the ancestral strain decreased significantly over time. After 6 months, 2.8% of the patients had a negative serological status for both anti-S and anti-NP IgG. However, all sera had a persistent and effective neutralizing effect against SARS-CoV-2. IgG levels correlated with seroneutralization, and this correlation was stronger for anti-S than for anti-NP antibodies. The level of seroneutralization quantified at 6 months correlated with markers of initial severity, notably admission to intensive care units and the need for mechanical invasive ventilation. In addition, sera collected at 6 months were tested against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and showed efficient neutralizing effects against the D614G, B.1.1.7, and P.1 variants but significantly weaker activity against the B.1.351 variant. Conclusions. Decrease in IgG rates and serological assays becoming negative did not imply loss of neutralizing capacity. Our results indicate a sustained humoral response against the ancestral strain and the D614G, B.1.1.7, and P.1 variants for at least 6 months in patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19. A weaker protection was, however, observed for the B.1.351 variant.</td>

      <td>Application of a fast and sensitive method for the determination of contaminants of emerging concern in wastewater using a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe-based extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry</td>
      <td>The inefficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) leads to their continuous release to the environment. Consequently, CECs are present at low concentrations in the treated wastewater (TWW), producing unpredicted and unwanted effects on living organisms as they are discharged into water receiving bodies. This work presents a fast and reliable method for the determination of CECs in TWW based on the innovative application of a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) method for water extraction and determination by sensitive liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QqLIT-MS/MS). The scope of the proposed QuEChERS-based method allows the monitoring of 107 CECs, including pharmaceuticals (58), antibiotics (16) and pesticides (33). The proposed method was successfully validated in urban TWW at two concentration levels (50 and 500 ng L(−1)) and it is a feasible alternative to conventional and time-consuming solid-phase extraction (SPE) methodologies. 89% of the CECs presented mean recovery values in the 70–120% range with relative standard deviations (RSDs) always &lt; 20% (intra and inter-day precision), and limits of quantification (LOQs) in the range 5–500 ng L(−1) (89% of the compounds showed a LOQ ≤ 50 ng L(−1)). The applicability of the method was demonstrated by the analysis of urban TWW samples (7 sampling events). In total, 35 CECs (23 pharmaceuticals, 2 antibiotics and 10 pesticides) were detected in the monitored samples with concentrations ranging from 5 to 677 ng L(−1).</td>

      <td>Background: Hajdu-Cheney syndrome (HCS) is a very rare autosomal-dominant congenital disease associated with mutations in the NOTCH2 gene. This disorder affects the connective tissue and is characterized by severe bone resorption. Hajdu-Cheney syndrome most frequently affects the head and feet bones (acroosteolysis). Case report: We present an extremely rare case of a 34-year-old male with Hajdu-Cheney syndrome. The patient was admitted to the Department of Oral Surgery, Medical University of Gdańsk, in order to perform the extraction of three teeth. These teeth were not eligible for conservative treatment and prosthetic reconstruction. The patient was treated with denosumab (angiogenesis and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB RANK ligand inhibitor, RANKL). Discussion: Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody against RANKL. This drug works through a suppression of osteoclast activity. In cases of patients in which the pathway of the RANK/RANKL/osteoprotegerin is dysregulated, denosumab has been approved for the treatment off-label. In patients receiving denosumab, a delayed wound healing in the oral cavity and osteonecrosis may occur. Dental procedures involving the alveolar bone process (tooth extractions and bone alveoloplasty) may be a risk factor for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). Spontaneous osteonecrosis is rarely observed. MRONJ consists of the destruction of exposed bone, with the exposure persisting for a minimum of 6–8 weeks. This is the first article about an HCS patient treated with denosumab who underwent invasive oral surgery procedures. This case report highlights the difficulties for professionals occurring during the oral surgery procedures in such patients.</td>

      <td>Background: Solid organ transplant (SOT) and stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients are at increased risk of invasive fungal disease despite normal neutrophil counts. Here, we measure neutrophil anti-Candida activity. Methods: Twenty-one SOT and 19 SCT recipients were enrolled 2-4 months posttransplant and compared to 23 healthy control patients (HC). Neutrophils were coincubated with Candida albicans, and percentage killing and swarming responses were measured. Results: Neutrophils from transplant patients had decreased fungicidal capacity compared to HC (42%, 43%, and 72% for SCT, SOT, and HC, respectively; SCT vs HC: P &lt;. 0001; SOT vs HC: P &lt;. 0001; SOT vs SCT: P =. 8), including diminished ability to control hyphal growth (HC vs SOT: 0.1455 vs 0.3894, P ≤. 001; HC vs SCT: 0.1455 vs 0.6295, P ≤. 0001, respectively). Serum from SCT, but not SOT, recipients, inhibited the ability of HC neutrophils to control C. albicans (37%, 45%, and 55% for SCT, SOT, and HC, respectively). Neutrophils' control of hyphal growth was partially restored with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Conclusions: Despite normal circulating numbers, our data suggest that neutrophils from SOT and SCT recipients mount dysfunctional responses against C. albicans. Intrinsic neutrophil changes and extrinsic serum factors may be responsible for the dysfunction, which is partially reversed with cytokine augmentation.</td>

In this work, we evaluated the occurrence and predictive factors of "traditional"cardiovascular risk factors, with a focus on high blood pressure (HBP), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and metabolic syndrome (MetS), in participants with RA, in a 3-year, multicentre, prospective, observational study. Methods To assess the occurrence and predictive factors of HBP, T2D, and MetS, consecutive participants with RA, admitted to Italian Rheumatology Units, were evaluated in the GIRRCS (Gruppo Italiano di Ricerca in Reumatologia Clinica e Sperimentale) cohort, a 3-year, multicentre, prospective, observational study. Results In the present evaluation, 841 participants, who were fully followed up with 3-year of prospective follow-up were assessed. At the end of follow-up, a significant increased incidence of HBP, T2D, and MetS was recorded. Assessing predictive factors, the mean values of C-reactive protein during the follow-up were independent predictors of occurrence of those comorbidities, whereas participants maintaining remission showed a significant lower risk. Furthermore, therapy with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reduced the risk of occurrence of T2D and MetS. Conclusion An increased incidence of HBP, T2D, and MetS was observed in assessed participants, prospectively followed-up. Furthermore, the analysis of predictive factors suggested that the rheumatoid pro-inflammatory process could increase the occurrence of these comorbidities. Conversely, metabolic and cardiovascular benefits of maintaining remission as well as of therapy with HCQ were reported.</td>

      <td>The safety profile of hydroxychloroquine: Major cutaneous and extracutaneous adverse events</td>
      <td>Hydroxychloroquine is an established therapy for several rheumatological disorders, and very recently it has been proposed as a possible treatment for the new coronavirus disease 2019 even if recent randomised trials did not prove any benefit. Notably, hydroxychloroquine has been associated with a heterogeneous range of cutaneous and extra-cutaneous adverse events. We carried out a narrative review of the literature up to November 1st, 2020, related to the safety of hydroxychloroquine. In particular, cutaneous and extra-cutaneous adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine were reviewed. The following databases were consulted: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and ResearchGate. The research of articles was conducted by using the following search terms: ''hydroxychloroquine,"''adverse event/ effect,'' "cutaneous", "skin", "cardiotoxicity", "retinopathy", gastrointestinal and neurological toxicity". The main indication for which hydroxychloroquine was used in the reports was an immune mediated disorder. Adverse events were described mostly in females over 50 years of age. The most common cutaneous adverse effect was maculopapular and erythematous rash occurring within 4 weeks of initiating hydroxychloroquine and disappearing within few weeks of discontinuation. Gastrointestinal symptoms and headache were the most frequent extracutaneous manifestations. Rarer cutaneous manifestations include hyperpigmentation, psoriasiform dermatitis, photodermatitis, stomatitis, melanonychia and hair loss. More severe conditions were acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, and among extra-cutaneous adverse events cardiotoxicity and retinopathy. Since hydroxychloroquine is widely prescribed in rheumatology, it is important for rheumatologists to be familiar with its safety profile.</td>

Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, including patients receiving HCT between June 2010 and December 2017 from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, AAUC was calculated for patients with detected VL. Patients were categorized into non-controllers (Q4) and controllers (Q1-Q3) using the highest AAUC quartile as cutoff. Cox models were used to estimate the association between AAUC and OS. Patients with non-detected CMV VL were categorized into elite-controllers (recipient+ [R+] or R-/donor+ [D+]) and R-/D-. Results: The study (N = 952) included 282 controllers, 93 non-controllers, 275 elite-controllers, and 302 R-/D-. OS was 80.1% and 58.1% for controllers and non-controllers, respectively. In multivariable models, non-controllers had worse OS versus controllers (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-4.12). In landmark analyses, controllers had similar OS as elite-controllers (HR = 1.26; 95% CI,. 83-1.91) or R-/D- (HR = 0.98; 95% CI,. 64-1.5). Conclusions: Non-controllers had worse OS 1-year post-HCT. Controllers had similar OS as elite-controllers or R-/D-. Future studies are needed to validate our AAUC cutoff across different cohorts and CMV management strategies.</td>

Methods Human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells were divided into three groups and cultured with blank solvent, LPS and LPS + LIG respectively. The proliferation of BEAS-2B cells was determined by CCK-8 assay, while the apoptosis by flow cytometry and Hoeschst33258 staining, and the micromo-rphology was observed by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). The immunofluorescence after transfection of GFP-LC3 fluorescent plasmid was observed by laser confocal microscopy, while the expression levels of apoptosis- and autophagy-associated proteins were determined by Western blot. The cells treated with LPS + LIG were added with autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or 3-methylpurine (MA), and determined for proliferation and apoptosis by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry respectively. Results LPS inhibited the proliferation of BEAS-2B cells in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in significantly increasing of apoptosis rate. However, LIG effectively alleviated the apoptosis of BEAS-2B cells induced by LPS. Abnormal morphology of mitochondria was observed in BEAS-2B cells treated with LPS by TEM. The increased autophagic vacuoles and the fusion of mitochondria and autophagy vacuoles were observed in the cells in LIG + LPS groups. After transfection of BEAS-2B cells with GFP-LC3 plasmid, the fluorescent spots of GFP in LPS group significantly decreased as compared with those in control group, while increased significantly after addition with LIG. The expression levels of apoptosis-associated proteins in BEAS-2B cells in LPS group increased, while those of autophagy-associated proteins decreased significantly, which were partially reversed by the addition of LIG. The addition of autophagy inhibitor HCQ or 3-MA partially relieved the protective effect of LIG on LPS-induced damage of BEAS-2B cells. Conclusion LIG might alleviate the LPS-induced lung epithelial BEAS-2B cell damage by promoting the protective autophagy.</td>

Methods Patients with CHB who initiated AVT were retrospectively recruited from 13 referral Korean institutes. The modified risk estimation for hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis B (mREACH-B) model was selected for the analysis. Results Between 2007 and 2015, 1034 patients with CHB were recruited. The mean age of the study population (639 men and 395 women) was 46.8 years. During AVT, the mREACH-B score significantly decreased from the baseline to 3 years of AVT (mean 9.21 → 7.46, P &lt; 0.05) and was maintained until 5 years of AVT (mean 7.23, P &gt; 0.05). The proportion of high-risk patients (mREACH-B score ≥11) was significantly reduced from the baseline to 2 years of AVT (36.4% → 16.4%, P &lt; 0.001) and was maintained until 5 years of AVT (12.2%, P &gt; 0.05). The mREACH-B scores at baseline and 1 year of AVT independently predicted HCC development (hazard ratio = 1.209-1.224) (all P &lt; 0.05). The cumulative incidence rate of HCC was significantly different at 5 years of AVT among risk groups (high vs. high-intermediate vs. low-intermediate vs. low) from baseline (4.5% vs. 3.2% vs. 1.5% vs. 0.8%) and 1 year (11.8% vs. 4.6% vs. 1.8% vs. 0.6%) (all P &lt; 0.05, log-rank tests). Conclusions The mREACH-B score was dynamically changed during AVT. Thus, repeated assessment of the mREACH-B score is required to predict the changing risk of HCC development in patients with CHB undergoing AVT.</td>

The virus reactivates in immunodeficiency states, mostly among transplant (either kidney or bone marrow) recipients. There are approximately 15 000 renal transplants every year in the USA, of which 5-10% develop BK polyomavirus nephropathy; 50-80% of patients who develop nephropathy go on to develop graft failure. BK virus is associated with BK polyomavirus nephropathy, ureteral stenosis, late-onset hemorrhagic cystitis, bladder cancer and other nonlytic large T-expressing carcinomas. The renal spectrum begins with viruria and can end with graft failure. The clinical spectrum and outcomes vary among transplant patients. New noninvasive diagnostic methods, such as urinary polyomavirus Haufen detected by electron microscopy, are currently under study. Treatment is primarily directed at decreasing immunosuppression but may be associated with graft rejection. Repeat transplantation is encouraged as long as viral clearance in plasma prior to transplant is accomplished. There remain no definitive data regarding the utility of transplant nephrectomy.</td>

Screening of the Harbor Branch enriched fraction library against the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistant strain (Dd2) followed by bioassay-guided fractionation led to the identification of two potent antiplasmodials; a novel diterpene designated as bebrycin A (1) and the known C21 degraded terpene nitenin (2). A SYBR Green I assay was used to establish a Dd2 EC(50) of 1.08 ± 0.21 and 0.29 ± 0.02 µM for bebrycin A and nitenin, respectively. Further analysis was then performed to assess the stage specificity of the inhibitors antiplasmodial effects on the Dd2 intraerythrocytic life cycle. Exposure to bebrycin A was found to block parasite maturation at the schizont stage if added any time prior to late schizogony at 42 hours post invasion, (HPI). In contrast, early life cycle exposure to nitenin (prior to 18 HPI) was identified as crucial to parasite inhibition, suggesting nitenin may target the maturation of the parasite during the transition from ring to early trophozoite (6–18 HPI), a novel property among known antimalarials.</td>

Repeated exposure to and immunomodulation by parasite infections may be important. We focus on Plasmodium falciparum malaria, aiming to determine whether there are reversible effects of malaria infection on vaccine responses. Methods and analysis We have designed a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial of intermittent preventive malaria treatment versus placebo, to determine effects on vaccine response outcomes among school-going adolescents (9 to 17 years) from malaria-endemic rural areas of Jinja district (Uganda). Vaccines to be studied comprise BCG vaccine on day 'zero'; yellow fever, oral typhoid and human papilloma virus vaccines at week 4; and tetanus/diphtheria booster vaccine at week 28. Participants in the intermittent preventive malaria treatment arm will receive dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine (DP) dosed by weight, 1 month apart, prior to the first immunisation, followed by monthly treatment thereafter. We expect to enrol 640 adolescents. Primary outcomes are BCG-specific interferon-γELISpot responses 8 weeks after BCG immunisation and for other vaccines, antibody responses to key vaccine antigens at 4 weeks after immunisation. In secondary analyses, we will determine effects of monthly DP treatment (versus placebo) on correlates of protective immunity, on vaccine response waning, on whether there are differential effects on priming versus boosting immunisations, and on malaria infection prevalence. We will also conduct exploratory immunology assays among subsets of participants to further characterise effects of the intervention on vaccine responses. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval has been obtained from relevant Ugandan and UK ethics committees. Results will be shared with Uganda Ministry of Health, relevant district councils, community leaders and study participants. Further dissemination will be done through conference proceedings and publications. Trial registration number Current Controlled Trials identifier: ISRCTN62041885.</td>

      <td>Equity considerations in outcome measures of the HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis care continuum in high-income countries: A systematic review protocol</td>
      <td>Introduction HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective intervention to reduce acquisition of HIV. PrEP provision has increased in recent years, however, it is not known whether PrEP implementation has been equitably implemented across all risk groups, particularly groups experiencing high levels of health inequity. A PrEP care continuum (PCC) has been proposed to evaluate the success of PrEP implementation programmes, but the extent to which health equity characteristics are currently taken into account in the PCC has not been described. The objectives of this proposed systematic review are to (i) identify and collate outcome measure definitions for the main stages of the PCC (awareness, acceptability, uptake, adherence and retention), (ii) describe how equity characteristics are considered in outcome definitions of the PCC and (iii) describe data sources for capturing equity characteristics. Methods and analysis Quantitative studies published between 1 January 2012 and 3 March 2020 will be included. Five databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts) will be searched to identify English language publications that include an outcome measure definition of at least one of the five main stages of the PCC. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Data on outcome measure definitions and equity characteristics will be extracted. Results will be presented in a narrative synthesis and all findings will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required. The results will be disseminated via submission for publication to a peer-reviewed journal when complete. The review findings will have relevance to healthcare professionals, policymakers and commissioners in informing how to best evaluate PrEP implementation programmes and inform new implementation strategies for vulnerable and less advantaged populations.

Classically, cystic echinococcosis is caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto, E. equinus, E. ortleppi and E. canadensis, though several other species have been implicated in hydatid disease. Echinococcus infection may lead to cystic disease of the liver, lungs and potentially other organs. Here we present a patient who had cystic disease of the lungs and liver. The patient initially experienced right upper quadrant pain and nausea, and later went on to develop a fever, cough and dyspnoea in the setting of hydropneumothorax. CT scan of the chest and abdomen revealed a large fluid collection at the left lung base and a large lobular complex fluid mass within the right lobe of the liver. Echinococcus titres were positive. The patient was commenced on albendazole; however, experienced significant derangement of liver enzymes within the following month. In light of this, the albendazole was ceased, and a hemi-hepatectomy was performed. During the hemi-hepatectomy there was some cyst content spillage, and subsequently a washout with hypertonic saline 3% was performed. This was followed by a course of praziquantel 1200 mg two times per day for 14 days. Repeat CT 6 months later demonstrated no evidence of recurrence.</td>

The patient was treated for presumptive gonorrhoea and chlamydial infection with ceftriaxone, azithromycin and doxycycline. The patient failed to improve with this treatment regimen. Rectal swab results at 48 hours confirmed the causative agent to be herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2. The patient was recalled and treated successfully with valaciclovir.

      <td>Objective: The delivery of pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing has primarily been through clinical and hospital settings. We conducted a study to explore the feasibility of delivering PGx testing through community pharmacies, a less-studied setting. Methods: We conducted a cluster randomized trial of community pharmacies in North Carolina through two approaches: the provision of PGx testing alone or PGx testing with medication therapy management (MTM). Results: A total of 150 patient participants were enrolled at 17 pharmacies and reported high satisfaction with their testing experience. Participants in the PGx plus MTM arm were more likely to recall a higher number of results (p=0.04) and more likely to clearly understand their choices for prevention or early detection of side effects (p=0.01). A medication or dose change based on the PGx results was made for 8.7% of participants. Conclusion: Limited differences were observed in the provision of PGx testing as a standalone test or combined with MTM. A limited number of treatment changes were made based on PGx test results. Patient acceptance of PGx testing offered through the community pharmacy was very high, but the addition of MTM did not impact patient-reported perceptions about PGx testing or medication adherence.</td>

      <td>Inflammation in neurocysticercosis: clinical relevance and impact on treatment decisions</td>
      <td>Introduction: Neurocysticercosis is caused by the localization of Taenia solium larvae in the central nervous system. The disease remains endemic in most countries of Latin America, Asia and Africa. While major improvements have been made in its diagnosis and treatment, uncertainties persist regarding the clinical implications and treatment of the inflammatory reaction associated with the disease. Areas covered: In this review, based on PubMed searches, the authors describe the characteristics of the immune-inflammatory response in patients with neurocysticercosis, its clinical implications and the treatment currently administered. The dual role of inflammation (participating in both, the death of the parasite, and the precipitation of serious complications) is discussed. New therapeutic strategies of potential interest are presented. Expert opinion: Inflammatory reaction is the main pathogenic mechanism associated to neurocysticercosis. Its management is mainly based on corticosteroids administration. This strategy had improved prognostic of patients as it allows for the control of most of the inflammatory complications. On the other side, it might be involved in the persistence of parasites in some patients, despite cysticidal treatment, due to its immunosuppressive properties. New strategies are needed to improve therapeutical management, particularly in the severest presentations.</td>

      <td>High-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation are the best treatment options in patients with multiple myeloma. Numerous medicines have been studied as a maintenance treatment after transplantation. Still, the use of medications that, in addition to their maintenance properties, eliminate or delay relapse of the disease has always been researchers' purpose. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of MST-312 after stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. For this purpose, 73 patients with multiple myeloma after stem cell transplantation were studied. Thirty-five patients were in the case group, and 37 patients were in the control group. The case group was treated with 100 mg/day MST-312. Stem cell survival was evaluated in the two groups. Also, the expression of TNFα and IL-6 genes were evaluated by the Real-time PCR technique. The results showed no significant difference between the two groups in terms of stem cell survival in the first year (P=0.72) and second years of treatment (P=0.66). But there was a significant difference between the two groups regarding progression-free survival (PFS) in the first year (P=0.041) and the second year (P=0.029). These results indicate that MST-312 inhibits the progress of the disease by inhibiting the telomerase activity of myeloma cells. Genetic evaluations also showed that IL-6 and TNF-α genes were significantly reduced in the case group. Therefore, it could be suggested that MST-312 has a selective inhibitory effect on myeloma cell growth and can be indicated as a suitable candidate for treating multiple myeloma.</td>

      <td>Impact of adherence to pharmacotherapy in rheumatic diseases</td>
      <td>Adherence to therapy is a primary determinant of treatment success. Poor adherence atenuates optimum clinical benefits and therefore reduces the overal effectivness of health systems. According to the World Health Organization, risk factors/predictors for nonadherence may be categorized based on five interacting dimensions: socioeconomic, health-care system-related, disease-related, therapy-related, and patient-related. Nonadherence to pharmacotherapy may include non-acceptance of drug prescription start, poor execution of the drug regimen, discontinuation and the drug prescription end. Databases on adherence to pharmacotherapy in rheumatic diseases include a large amount of prospective and retrospective studies with variable methods of investigation, i.e. from questionaries and detection the presence of drugs or metabolites in biologic fluids up to sophisticated electronic telemetry. A data are suggestive that nonadherence to pharmacotherapy should be a risk factor even to fatal prognosis, incl. nonadherence in relation to placebo. In this connection a characteristics of nonadherence syndrome were declared. In rheumatic diseases were analysed especially data as follows: disease modyfying anti-rheumatic drug therapy in rheumatoid arthritis, glucocorticoids in polymyalgia rheumatica, hydroxychloroquine and immunosuppressive therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus and uric acid blockers in gout. A good information on poor adherence to pharmacotherapy of rheumatic diseases suppose successful education of patients in the whole clinical practice.</td>

      <td>Introduction: Cutis calcification is the deposition of calcium in the skin and subcutaneous tissues and is classified into four subsets. Dystrophic calcifications are the most common type of skin calcification, occurring mainly in damaged tissues or in course of autoimmune disease. However, the coexistance of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and soft tissue calcification is described rarely. Ai m: This article presents a case of dystrophic calcifications in the buttocks area in a 49-year-old woman with a 17-year history of SLE. Ca s e s t udy: We report a case of 49-year-old women with SLE who developed nodular lesions in the buttock area. The radiological and histopatological examinations of the nodules showed presence of calcifications. The calcium metabo-lism parameters were in a normal range. The diagnosis of dystrophic calcinosis in the course of SLE was established. Re s ul t s a nd di s c us s i o n: Dystrophic calcifications associated with autoimmune diseases are common, but occur rarely in SLE. It should be noted that patients with SLE can also develop calcifications of different types like metastatic or iatrogenic. Dystrophic calcifications in SLE usually present as small nodules on buttocks or limbs. The pathophysiology remains unclear, however, there are some theories that inflammation and vascular ischemia play a role in its process. Co nc l us i o ns: Calcifications in case of patients with SLE rarely require treat-ment. Several pharmacologic and surgical therapies have been tested with variable results. Additional research to establish an accepted treatment algorithm should be conducted.</td>

      <td>Introduction: Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder that affects approximately twenty million people worldwide. Various factors have been associated with the physiopathology of this disease such as oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant molecules. Objective: This study evaluated the association between biomarkers of oxidative stress and response to pharmacological treatment among patients with schizophrenia in the context of their clinical information, demographic data, and lifestyle. Methods: A total of 89 subjects were included, 26 of whom were treatment-responsive schizophrenia patients (Group 1), 27 treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients (Group 2), and 36 healthy controls (Group 3). All of the subjects completed a questionnaire to provide clinical and demographic data, and all provided peripheral blood samples. The oxidative stress markers analyzed using spectrophotometry were catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), total glutathione (GSH-t), malondialdehyde (MDA), and Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC; p &lt; 0.05). Results: When all schizophrenia patients (G1 + G2) were compared to the control group, SOD levels were found to be lower among schizophrenia patients (p &lt; 0.0001), while MDA and CAT levels were higher (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.0191, respectively). GPx, GSH-t, and TEAC levels were similar in all three groups (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: Lower SOD levels and higher MDA and CAT levels indicate oxidative damage in schizophrenia patients, regardless of their response to pharmacological treatment. Smoking is associated with oxidative stress, in addition, a family history of the disease was also found to be correlated with cases of schizophrenia, which reflects the relevance of genetics in disease development.</td>

      <td>Endothelial dysfunction associated with chronic microcrystalline inflammation plays a role in the progression of atherosclerosis in calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition diseases (CPPD). The aim of the study was to assess the dynamics of the development of atherosclerosis based on changes in the thickness of the intima-media complex (ICIM) of the carotid arteries (CA) in patients with CPPD receiving long-term anti-inflammatory therapy (colchicine, methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine). Materials and methods. 26 patients with CPPD and 26 patients with osteoarthritis aged over 18 years old were included. Exclusion criteria: age &gt;65 years; presence of cardiovascular diseases. The blood lipid spectrum, hs-CRP level, anthropometric parameters were determined for all, and Doppler ultrasound ultrasonography of the carotid arteries (CA) was performed. Patients were followed up for not &lt;6 months, assessed ICIM CA at 1 visit, then patients with CPPD, at the discretion of the attending physician, were prescribed methotrexate at a dose of 15 mg per week, hydroxychloroquine 200 mg 1 time per day or colchicine 0.5 mg 2 times a day. Patients could take NSAIDs if they were in pain. The SCORE index has been calculated for everyone. Results. Initially, ICIM values did not differ in patients with CPPD and OA. Initially, ICIM&gt;0.9 mm were detected in 11 of 22 (50%) patients with CPPD and in OA in 8 of 19 (42%) (p=0.39). In dynamics, patients with CPPD revealed a decrease in the number of patients with ICIM&gt;0.9 mm from 42 to 18%. At the same time, in 8 patients with CPPD, ICIM&gt;0.9 mm was combined with a CRP level &gt;0.2 mg/l. Out of 22 patients with CPPD, 14 (64%) patients showed a decrease in the mean values of ICIM, in 2 (9%) patients – an increase, in 5 patients the mean values of ICIM did not change. After 6 months of therapy, out of 11 patients with CPPD with ICIM &gt;0.9 mm, after 6 months of therapy, in 7 cases there was a decrease in the indicator less than the specified value, in 5 of them a decrease in serum CRP level &lt;2 mg/l was recorded. In patients with CPPD, the serum CRP level significantly decreased; in patients with OA, it did not change. Out of 19 patients with OA, 9 (47%) patients showed an increase in the mean ICIM over time, while the rest did not change. In those treated with hydroxychloroquine, a decrease in the mean ICIM parameters was observed in 5 out of 6 (83%) patients, colchicine – in 6 out of 9 (67%) patients, methotrexate – in 4 out of 7 (57%) patients. With CPPD, the result of therapy with colchicine, methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine in relation to the development of the initial signs of atherosclerosis according to Doppler ultrasound ultrasonography of CA can be realized based on the presence of chronic inflammation.</td>

      <td>Background: The efficacy of nucleot(s)ide analogs (NAs) and pegylated interferon (PegIFN) combination therapy for hepatitis B e antigen-positive (HBeAg+) patients is still controversial. Whether PegIFN and entecavir (ETV) combination therapy could provide a greater benefit for HBeAg+ patients was assessed. Methods: Treatment-naïve HBeAg+ patients initiated on PegIFN alfa-2a (PegIFNα-2a) for 24 weeks without early response (early response: HBsAg &lt;1500 IU/mL and hepatitis B virus [HBV] DNA &lt;105 copies/mL) were recruited in the current study. Among total of 94 patients, 51 were continued on PegIFNα-2a monotherapy, and 43 were offered PegIFNα-2a and ETV combined therapy. Results: Better outcomes in response to the combined therapy, compared with that of the monotherapy, were demonstrated, including more HBsAg decline and loss and HBV DNA decline and HBeAg clearance. Importantly, the patients with HBsAg levels between 1500 and 20000 IU/mL initially or between 5000 and 20000 IU/mL after 24 weeks of PegIFNα-2a benefitted more from the combined therapy, compared with those on monotherapy. Conclusions: Combined therapy of PegIFNα-2a and ETV is more efficacious for HBeAg+ patients without early response to PegIFN monotherapy, and HBsAg levels are a good predictor of treatment outcomes.</td>

      <td>Evaluation of topical lysostaphin as a novel treatment for instrumented rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus</td>
      <td>Lytic enzymes are novel antimicrobial agents that degrade bacterial cell walls, resulting in cell rupture and death. We tested one enzyme, the bacteriocin lysostaphin, for treatment of nonhuman primates (Macaca mulatta) with persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection of their cranial implant margins. The goal of this study was to determine if topical lysostaphin, either alone or as an adjunct therapy, could eliminate MRSA. Lysostaphin had in vitro lytic activity against all 4 previously identified NHP MRSA clones, as well as against 12 MRSA isolates of the same clonal type (MLST ST3862 and spa type t4167) before and after treatment, with no resistance discovered. In an in vivo pilot study, a 2-d application of lysostaphin alone reduced MRSA in the implant margins by 3-logs during treatment of one animal; however, MRSA titers had returned to control levels by 1 wk after treatment. In the main study, all animals (n = 4) received 10 d of systemic antibiotic treatment and both the animals and their environment (cages, equipment, room) underwent 5-d of decontamination. The experimental animals (n = 2) received 5 doses of topical lysostaphin (15 mg, every other day) applied onto their implant margins. Daily cultures showed that MRSA counts decreased significantly (≤ 25 colony-forming units/mL; P &lt; 0.05). However, sampling of the cranial implant margin 7 d after last treatment showed that MRSA counts had returned to control levels. Our study suggests that lysostaphin, coupled with other treatment modalities, can decrease MRSA infection short-term but do not completely eradicate MRSA in the long-term. This reappearance of MRSA may be due to cross-contamination or reinfection from other infected areas, an inability of the treatment to reach all colonized areas, or insufficient dosing or length of treatment. Topical lysostaphin may be more useful clinically for superficial nonimplant associated wounds in which the lytic enzyme has better access to the infected tissue.</td>

      <td>Accurate definition of the extent and severity of left-ventricular assist device (LVAD) infection may facilitate therapeutic decision making and targeted surgical intervention. Here, we explore the value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for guidance of patient management. Methods: Fifty-seven LVAD-carrying patients received 85 whole-body (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans for the work-up of device infection. Clinical follow-up was obtained for up to 2 y. Results: PET/CT showed various patterns of infectious involvement of the 4 LVAD components: driveline entry point (77% of patients), subcutaneous driveline path (87%), pump pocket (49%), and outflow tract (58%). Driveline smears revealed Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas strains as the underlying pathogen in most cases (48 and 34%, respectively). At receiver-operating-characteristic analysis, an (18)F-FDG SUV of more than 2.5 was most accurate to identify smear-positive driveline infection. Infection of 3 or all 4 LVAD components showed a trend toward lower survival than did infection of 2 or fewer components (P 5 0.089), whereas involvement of thoracic lymph nodes was significantly associated with an adverse outcome (P 5 0.001 for nodal SUV above vs. below median). Finally, patients who underwent early surgical revision within 3 mo after PET/CT (n 5 21) required significantly less inpatient hospital care during follow-up than did those receiving delayed surgical revision (n 5 11; P, 0.05). Conclusion: Whole-body (18)F-FDG PET/CT identifies the extent of LVAD infection and predicts adverse outcome. Initial experience suggests that early image-guided surgical intervention may facilitate a less complicated subsequent course.</td>

The study addresses the problem of the presence of primarily resistant bacterial strains in the boar sperm, which, due to their reduced sensitivity, cannot be suppressed by antibiotics used in the semen dilution agent, as well as to emphasize the importance of microbiological monitoring of the boar mucous membranes and ambient surfaces before and during their exploitation. Such an examination could contribute to the interchangeable design of the dilution agent for the boar semen relative to the antibiotic content.Resistant strains of bacteria from prepuce swabs and swabs taken from the facility, as well as from native boar semen were isolated. The presence of these bacteria affected the quality of the semen. In conclusion, it should be pointed out that bacterial monitoring of the prepuce and surface of the facility can indicate possible problems related to the quality of semen, and that the design of the dilution agent for boar semen should be adjusted to the established resistance of isolated bacteria.</td>

Class A β-lactamase blaGES-11 and Class D β-lactamase Oxa23, responsible for hydrolysis of different types of β-lactam antibiotics, were found to be cross-linked to similar lysine sites of the periplasmic domain of outer membrane protein OmpA, despite low sequence homology between the two enzymes. The findings from in vivo XL-MS suggest that the interacting surfaces between both β-lactamase enzymes and OmpA are conserved during molecular evolution, and the OmpA C-terminus domain serves an important function of anchoring different types of β-lactamase enzymes in the periplasmic space.</td>

This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of high level gentamicin resistant Enterococci (HLGRE) and the distribution of high level gentamicin resistant genes in them. A total of 550 urine samples were taken from patients in a tertiary care hospital. Among them, a total of 46 Enterococci were isolated and subsequently analyzed. Enterococci were screened for HLGR by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of all isolates for gentamicin was determined by agar dilution method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out for HLGR Enterococcus isolates to identify aminoglycoside modifying enzymes genes responsible for resistance. Among the isolated Enterococci, 17 (36.97%) were resistant to high level gentamicin by disc diffusion method. Nineteen (41.3%) Enterococci were positive for HLGR by both MIC method (MIC&gt; 500 μg/mL) and by PCR. Only aac (6’)-Ie-aph (2”)-Ia gene was found to responsible for HLGR and other genes such as aph (2”)-Ib and aph (2”)-Ic gene were not detected in this study. High frequency of HLGRE (41.3%) may be regarded as a warning to the community. In identifying HLGRE, along with disc diffusion method, the MIC method should also be adopted routinely.</td>

Due to scarce clinical and experimental data on the ability of stress to induce oral candidiasis, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of stress on oral candidiasis in healthy BALB/c mice and compare its effect to other predisposing factors of oral candidiasis. Immunocompetent and immunocompromised BALB/c female mice were orally infected with C. albicans. A total of four groups of mice each receiving a different treatment were screened. Treatments included antibiotics, corticosteroids and chronic unpredictable stress. Oral tissue colonization and infection was inspected and evaluated comparatively in each group. Tissue burden on day 14 post challenge was measured and mice tongues were inspected for white patches and studied histo-pathologically for evidence of colonization or infection. The induced stress model was able to result in oral colonization and infection without the use of antibiotics or immuno-suppressants. Moreover, the fungal burden was significantly greater in stressed group than that in groups receiving antibiotics treatment or control group. Histopathological examination revealed the abundant presence of C. albicans cells with pseudo-hyphae and in the yeast form, in all tongue tissue samples of treated mice. Tissues were intact in the control group and Candida cells count was significantly lower in the treated unstressed group. White patches were significantly more dominant in stressed group than non-stressed and control group. In conclusion, stress maybe a more potent predisposing factor than the use of antibiotics in inducing oral candidiasis, although being a weaker factor than the combined use of antibiotics and corticosteroids together.</td>

This study aims to evaluatethe genotypic resistance profile of Escherichia coli ESBL-producing isolated from weaned piglets stools in Abidjan. Escherichia coli were isolated on Mac Conkey medium from 40 stools samples obtained from a farm in Adiopodoumé locality. Then, antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using disk diffusion methodon Müller-Hinton agar to screen ESBL-producing Escherichia coli. In order to spot β-lactamase genes (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), and bla(CTX-M) ), polymerase chain reaction was conducted. Antibiotic susceptibility test reveals that 58 of 330 strains isolatedare ESBL-producing (17.5%). All of these strains were resistant to tetracycline, amoxicillin and piperacillin and all were sensitive to imipenem and colistin. Escherichia coli producing-ESBL also showed relatively high levels of resistance to nalidixic acid (58.7%), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (56.9%) and ciprofloxacin (41.4%). The findings obtained from simplex PCR assay showed that out of collected strains of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, had 70.7% bla(TEM), 20.7% bla(CTX-M) and 48.3% bla(SHV) genes. TEM prevalence was high among other types of ESBLs. Escherichia coli ESBL-producing of swine origin could be released into environment and cause public health concerns. It is therefore necessary to set up surveillance plan of ESBL in pig farm.</td>

This study aims to assess monocyte subpopulations, monocyte expression of CD163, plasma sCD163, and sTWEAK in patients with chronic HBeAg-negative HBV infection at different phases of disease. Methods. Fifty-nine patients with CHB, 9 with a history of HBsAg/anti-HBs seroconversion, were enrolled. The control group consisted of 15 healthy volunteers. Subpopulations of peripheral blood monocytes were distinguished by CD14 and CD16. Membrane expression of CD163 was assessed by flow cytometry, plasma sCD163 concentration by ELISA, and sTWEAK by bead-based multiplexed immunoassay system. Results. CD163 expression was increased in classical and intermediate monocytes in CHB patients and those with HBsAg/anti-HBs seroconversion. CD163 expression on classical monocytes was associated with status of immune control and thus significant in HBV infection as compared to active hepatitis. Plasma sCD163 concentration was increased in CHB patients and those with HBsAg/anti-HBs seroconversion vs. the control group. Positive correlations between plasma sCD163 and ALT, as well as APRI, were observed. Plasma sTWEAK concentration was lower in CHB patients in comparison to patients with HBsAg/anti-HBs seroconversion. Conclusions. Exposure to HBV antigens alters monocyte subsets' frequencies and activation. The expression of CD163 on classical monocytes increased in parallel with improved immune control of the HBV infection. Patients who seroconverted HBsAg had the highest expression of CD163 on monocytes, which suggests involvement of monocytes in immune control of HBV infection. Persistent inflammation is accompanied by higher CD163 expression and sCD163 level and lower sTWEAK level.</td>

With a dearth of data on neonatal sepsis in our country, this study was conducted to determine the incidence of clinical neonatal sepsis and evaluate the clinical, bacteriological, and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of organisms. Material and Methods. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted in the Neonatal Unit of the National Hospital from 1st January to 31st December 2016. All neonates admitted with suspected clinical sepsis were included. Sepsis screens and cultures were sent under aseptic conditions. Data was analyzed using STATA™ version 12. Clinical features and neonatal and maternal risk factors were analyzed using chi-squared test. Bacteriological profile was analyzed with descriptive statistics. Results. During the study period, incidence of culture positive neonatal sepsis was 19 per 1000 admissions with a blood culture positivity rate of 14%. 54.5% had culture-positive early-onset sepsis (EOS). Prematurity (p=0.012), APGAR&lt;6 (p=0.018), low birth weight (p&lt;0.001), and maternal intrapartum antibiotics (p=0.031) significantly increased risk for culture-positive EOS. Prematurity (p&lt;0.001), low birth weight (p=0.001), and parental nutrition (p=0.007) were significantly associated with increased risk of culture-positive late-onset sepsis. A positive screen had sensitivity of 81.8% and negative predictive value of 87.7%. Gram-negative organisms were most commonly isolated (64.6%). Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (31%) were the commonest isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (27%) and Acinetobacter (18.8%). Ninety percent of Acinetobacter were carbapenem resistant. Gram-negative sepsis had mortality of 88.9%. Conclusion.

      <td>High Clostridium difficile Infection among HIV-Infected Children with Diarrhea in a Tertiary Hospital in Mwanza, Tanzania</td>
      <td>Clostridium difficile causes a million of illnesses each year worldwide and can affect people of all ages. Limited data exist on the prevalence of C. difficile infections (CDI) among children below five years of age in developing countries. This study is aimed at determining the prevalence, associated factors, and outcome of the Clostridium difficile infection among children with diarrhea attending a tertiary hospital in Mwanza, Tanzania. Stool samples were collected and cultured anaerobically to isolate Clostridium difficile, followed by C. difficile toxin A and B assay and ribotyping. A total of 301 children with diarrhea were enrolled. A total of 22 (7.31%, 95% CI: 0.89-0.95) nonrepetitive stool samples were positive for Clostridium difficile. Eighteen (81%) of C. difficile isolates were toxigenic, and 16 (72.7%) had unknown ribotypes. Independent predictors of positive C. difficile were as follows: positive HIV status, hospital stay of more than four days, high stool leukocyte count, and watery stool. Clostridium difficile-positive children had significantly higher median duration of the diarrhea than those without C. difficile. Clinicians should consider C. difficile as a possible cause of diarrhea in children living in developing countries and institute appropriate management to prevent associated morbidities and mortalities. Furthermore, there is a need of joint effort to improve C. difficile diagnosis and surveillance in developing countries to establish the unknown epidemiology of CDI in these countries.</td>

We present the case of an immunocompetent patient without any risk factors except for age, ICU stay, and surgical intervention, who developed a septic shock by invasive gastrointestinal aspergillosis as primary infection. Due to the unusualness of the case, despite all the measures taken, the results were obtained postmortem. We want to emphasize the need not to underestimate the possibility for an invasive aspergillosis in an immunocompetent patient.

      <td>A Case of Vaping TCH Oil Leading to Vaping Associated Pulmonary Injury: Our Approach to Its Diagnosis, Management, and Recommendations</td>
      <td>Vaping's popularity has grown exponentially since its introduction to the US market in 2003. Its use has sky-rocketed since the unveiling of the vaping pods in 2017 which may account for the advent of the vaping related illnesses we are now seeing. Substances such as nicotine solution, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) oil, cannabidiol (CBD) oil, and butane hash oil (BHC) packaged in cartridges available in various flavors and concentrations are aerosolized by the heating of metal coils in the e-cigarette/vaping devices. Cases from all over the country have recently been coming to light in which vaping has led to severe acute pulmonary disease or vaping-associated-pulmonary-injury (VAPI). A vast majority of the presenting patients in the reported cases have required hospitalization and intensive care, needing supplemental oxygen and even endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. 98% of patients present with respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, chest pain, cough, hemoptysis), 81% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), and 100% of patients have constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, and fatigue/malaise on presentation. Although based on history and clinical presentation it is reasonable to have a high suspicion for VAPI, diagnostic workup to rule out alternative underlying causes such as infection, malignancy, or autoimmune process should be performed before establishing the diagnosis. Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the chest have predominantly shown ground-glass opacity in the lungs, often with areas of lobular or subpleural sparing. Although lung biopsies have been performed on a relatively low number of cases, lung injury patterns so far have shown acute fibrinous pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, or organizing pneumonia, usually bronchiolocentric, and accompanied by bronchiolitis. Treatment plans that have led to clinical improvement in the reported cases center around high-dose systemic steroids, although there are a lack of data regarding the best regimen and the absolute need for corticosteroids. The role of antibiotics appears to be limited once infection has definitively been ruled out. We present the case of a young male who vaped THC oil and developed severe acute pulmonary injury requiring mechanical ventilation and showed a remarkable response to high dose steroid therapy with improvement in clinical symptoms and resolution of diffuse ground glass opacity on repeat HRCT scan.</td>

This study sets out to assess and characterize drug use at the public primary healthcare centers (PPHCCs) in a rural county in Kenya, using the World Health Organization/International Network for the Rational Use of Drugs (WHO/INRUD) core drug use indicators methodology. Methods. Ten PPHCCs were randomly selected. From each PPHCC, ninety prescriptions from October to December 2018 were sampled and data extracted. Three hundred (30 per PPHCC) patients and ten (1 per PPHCC) dispensers were also observed and interviewed. The WHO/INRUD core drug use indicators were used to assess the patterns of drug use. Results. The average number of drugs per prescription was 2.9 (SD 0.5) (recommended: 1.6-1.8), and the percentage of drugs prescribed by generic names was 27.7% (recommended: 100%); the percentage of prescriptions with an antibiotic was 84.8% (recommended: 20.0-26.8%), and with an injection prescribed was 24.9% (recommended: 13.4-24.1%). The percentage of prescribed drugs from the Kenya Essential Medicines List was 96.7% (recommended: 100%). The average consultation time was 4.1 min (SD 1.7) (recommended: ≥10 min), the average dispensing time was 131.5 sec (SD 41.5) (recommended: ≥90 sec), the percentage of drugs actually dispensed was 76.3% (recommended: 100%), the percentage of drugs adequately labeled was 22.6% (recommended: 100%), and the percentage of patients with correct knowledge of dispensed drugs was 54.7% (recommended: 100%). Only 20% of the PPHCCs had a copy of KEML available, and 80% of the selected essential drugs assessed were available. Conclusion. The survey shows irrational drug use practices, particularly polypharmacy, nongeneric prescribing, overuse of antibiotics, short consultation time, and inadequacy of drug labeling. Effective programs and activities promoting the rational use of drugs are the key interventions suggested at all the health facilities.</td>

Pharmaceutical researchers are currently researching medications or preventive vaccines that may be used to treat and combat the spread of COVID-19. Health practitioners all over the world are treating patients with currently available antiviral drugs, primarily the protease inhibitors used for HIV treatment. The present study mainly aims to evaluate the potencies of eight anti-HIV drugs to inhibit coronavirus protease using in silico methods. Derivation of pharmacophore, identification of hit molecules, and checking their virtual inhibition efficacies on the COVID-19 protease were also carried out in the present investigation. Classification of eight drug molecules (atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir (amprenavir - metabolised product), saquinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, and indinavir) based on their molecular structures was completed and reported. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the main protease of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 protease) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank and prepared for computational studies using Edu PyMOL software. Docking studies were performed with AutoDock Vina software, and the results were evaluated with Discovery Studio software. The binding scores of the drugs on protease followed the order saquinavir &gt; nelfinavir &gt; lopinavir = indinavir &gt; darunavir &gt; amprenavir &gt; ritonavir &gt; atazanavir. Web servers such as PharmaGist and ZINCPharmer were employed to derive the 3D pharmacophore and to identify potential hit compounds, respectively. The identified hit molecules were docked with the SARS-CoV-2 protease and analysed. A detailed account of the type of interaction between the protease and the molecules is discussed. The majority of hit compounds displayed appreciable binding affinities on coronavirus protease. Three hit compounds possess structures similar to that of natural products, viz., flavonoids, and nucleoside. These molecules were hydrophilic and slightly deviated from Lipinski parameters. All other derived molecules obeyed the Lipinski rule. In vitro, in vivo, and toxicological studies of these compounds have to be performed before checking the actual druggability of these compounds.</td>

In this study, an ethnobotanical survey was undertaken to document medicinal plants used by traditional healers in the Ejisu-Juaben district in the Ashanti region of Ghana to treat infections and to further investigate the antibiofilm formation properties of selected plants in resisting pathogenic bacteria. Seventy medicinal plants used by traditional practitioners for the treatment of skin infections and wounds were documented from the ethnobotanical survey. Forty out of the seventy plants were collected and their methanol extracts evaluated for antimicrobial activity by the agar diffusion assay. Extracts that showed antibacterial activity were tested for biofilm inhibitory activity, and the most active plant was subsequently purified to obtain the active constituents. Biofilm formation was significantly mitigated by petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of Holarrhena floribunda stem bark. Bioassay-guided fractionation of an alkaloidal extract prepared from the methanol fraction led to the isolation of three steroidal alkaloids, namely, holonamine, holadienine, and conessine. The isolated compounds demonstrated varying degrees of biofilm formation inhibitory properties. The current study reveals that screening of indigenous medicinal plants could unravel potential leads to salvage the declining efficacy of conventional antibiotics. Holarrhena floribunda stem bark extract has strong biofilm formation inhibition properties, which could be attributed to the presence of steroidal alkaloids.</td>

      <td>Introduction: The optimal duration of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) therapy is unknown for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) recommends the cessation of NAs in selected non-cirrhotic HBeAg-negative patients achieving long-term (at least three years) virological suppression under treatment if close monitoring can be guaranteed after the cessation of NAs. This study aimed to test this “cut-off rule” in HBeAg-negative CHB patients treated with NAs. Materials and Methods: Seventy-one non-cirrhotic patients were treated with NAs for an average of nine (3-14) years before treatment was discontinued, and patients’ hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNAs were negative for an average of seven (3-13) years. After treatment cessation, serum HBV-DNA and alanine aminotransferase levels were monitored every four weeks for the first six months and every three months from six months to 12 months. The patients were followed-up for 48 weeks after treatment cessation. Results: In 48 weeks after NA treatment cessation, 30 of 71 patients (42.3%) experienced relaps. Hepatitis B e antigen seroreversion in two consecutive visits was observed in one patient (3.4%), HBV-DNA &gt;20,000 IU/ml twice was observed in 23 patients (76.6%), and both virological and biochemical relapses were observed in six patients (20%). Median retreatment time was 21.6 (4-48) weeks. There were no significant differences between relapsers and non-relapsers in terms of baseline features. Conclusion: Although the viral suppression time in NA treatment of HBeAg-negative CHB patients was longer than the EASL recommendation, the relapse rate was found to be similar to that in other studies. Our study has shown that applying EASL recommendations in patients meeting the suitable criteria who can be closely followed up is appropriate.</td>

Furthermore, we aimed to determine the types of carbapenemase enzyme responsible for carbapenem resistance and compare the activity of ceftolozane-tazobactam and CZA according to the types of carbapenemase enzymes produced. Materials and Methods: Twenty-two MDR isolates were investigated in the study. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolates were performed by VITEK 2 (BioMérieux, France) automated system. The activity of C/T and CZA was determined by the gradient strip test (Liofilchem MIC strip test, Italy). In all K. pneumoniae isolates, bla(IMP-1), bla(KPC), bla(NDM-1), bla(OXA-48) and bla(VIM) gene regions encoding the carbapenemase enzyme were investigated by using Xpert CARBA-R test kits (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) of the Gene-Xpert(®) system. Results: Ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance was detected in 21 (95%) isolates, whereas CZA resistance was detected in six (27%) isolates. Among the 22 K. pneumoniae isolates, NDM-1 gene region was detected in three, NDM-1+OXA-48 gene region was detected in two, OXA-48 was detected in eight, and KPC gene region was detected in nine isolates. VIM and IMP-1 gene regions were not detected. Ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance was detected in seven isolates, whereas CZA resistance was not detected among the eight K. pneumoniae isolates producing only OXA-48. NDM-1 and OXA-48 co-producing isolates were detected resistant to C/T and CZA with high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels (MIC ≥256 µg/ ml). All NDM-1 producing isolates had high MIC levels (MIC ≥256 µg/ml) to both C/T and CZA. Ceftazidime-avibactam resistance was detected in only one isolate, whereas C/T resistance was detected in all K. pneumoniae isolates producing KPC. Ceftolozane-tazobactam was detected inefficient whereas CZA was found very efficient in MDR K. pneumoniae isolates producing KPC. Conclusion: According to the obtained data, we detected the in vitro antibacterial activity of CZA against the MDR K. pneumoniae isolates was superior to that of C/T. Ceftolozane-tazobactam was found to be weakly efficient, whereas CZA was found to be highly efficient against the MDR K. pneumoniae isolates producing OXA-48 and KPC. Because avibactam can inhibit the activity of KPC-type carbapenemase, the combination drug CZA should be considered to be effective in the treatment of KPC-type carbapenemase-producing strains but noneffective against NDM-type carbapenemase-producing strains.</td>

It rapidly disseminated all over the world in a short time. This study described the demographic and clinical features of 479 coronavirus disease-2019 patients admitted to a designated pandemic hospital in İzmir, Turkey, and it aimed to incorporate our experiences into current literature. Materials and Methods: Patients confirmed with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction or by typical chest computed tomography findings and rapid antibody test positivity were enrolled in the study. Demographic and clinical data of the patients were extracted from electronic medical recordings. The patients were categorized into three groups based on the severity of clinical and laboratory findings: group 1, uncomplicated disease; group 2, mild/moderate disease; and group 3, severe disease. Demographic and clinical findings were compared between groups. Results: The mean age of the patients was 50.7±19.3 years; 50.5% of the patients were male. No significant difference was observed between gender distributions in groups. The most common symptoms on admission were cough (219, 45.7%), fever (187, 39%), fatigue (176, 36.7%), and dyspnea (63, 13.2%). The most frequently observed comorbidities were hypertension (129, 26.9%), diabetes (71, 14.8%), and chronic heart diseases (35, 7.3%). The patients in group 3 had shown significantly higer number of underlying diseases. On chest computed tomography, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding. C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, and procalcitonin were found to be in significantly increased levels in patients with severe disease. Conclusion: Our observations during the first three months of pandemic suggested that the patients can present with a varying degree of severity. Some prognostic markers can predict the progression of the disease. We emphasize that accumulating experiences in the management of the disease accompanied by up-to-date tracking of guidelines would enable us to face up against upcoming surges more effectively.</td>

      <td>Availability and Utilization of WHO Lifesaving Medicines for Children under Five in Public Health Facilities of the Jimma Zone, South West Ethiopia: A Cross-Sectional Survey</td>
      <td>Background. The increased morbidity and mortality rates in children under five in developing countries are mostly attributed to poor availability and failure of prescribing lifesaving medicines. This study was aimed at evaluating the availability and utilization of the WHO-recommended priority lifesaving medicines for children under five in public health facilities. Method. A cross-sectional survey complemented with a qualitative method was conducted in 14 health centers and four hospitals in the Jimma Zone, Ethiopia. In the facilities, we assessed the availability within the last half year and on the day of the visit. Utilization of the medicines was assessed through a review of patient records of the last one year. Twelve in-depth interviews were carried out to collect the qualitative data, and the analysis was executed using thematic analysis. Results. For treatment of pneumonia, amoxicillin dispersible tablets and gentamycin injection were available in 94.4% of the facilities. For treatment of malaria, artemether/lumefantrine was available in 61.1% of the facilities. For pain management, paracetamol tablets were available in 94.4% of the facilities. AZT+3TC+NEV for HIV/AIDS management was available in all facilities. At least one essential medicine was out of stock in the past six months with the average duration of 33.6 days in health centers and 28.25 days in hospitals. Oral rehydration salt and zinc (84.7%) and AZT+3TC+NEV (100%) had better utilization. However, for almost all cases, other nonpriority medicines were highly prescribed. Lack of administrative commitment, supply of near expiry products, complexity of diseases, and lack of customized child formulations were among the challenges of availability and utilization of those medicines. Conclusions. The overall availability of lifesaving medicines on the day of the visit was fairly good but with poor utilization in almost all facilities. Some products were not available for considerable length of time in the past six months.</td>

      <td>Isolated neuroparacoccidioidomycosis as a pseudotumoral lesion in the absence of systemic disease</td>
      <td>Background: Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic, progressive, noncontagious, and often chronic disease caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis that rarely affects the central nervous system (CNS). The condition is usually treated using antifungal drugs, and some cases may require surgery. Case Description: A 55-year-old man, a smoker, without known comorbidities, was referred to the neurosurgery team with a history of a single epileptic seizure a week before hospital admission followed by progressive right-sided hemiparesis. Head computed tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed an intra-Axial expansive lesion affecting the left parietal lobe, associated with extensive edema and a regional compressive effect producing slight subfalcine herniation that was initially managed as an abscess. After the failure of antibiotic treatment, the patient underwent a neurosurgical procedure for excision of the lesion. Histopathological analysis revealed that it was PCM and there was no evidence of impairment of other systems due to the disease. Conclusion: PCM can be a serious, debilitating disease and is potentially fatal. Although isolated CNS involvement is rare, it must be considered, especially in endemic areas, as late diagnosis and treatment severely decreases good outcome rates.</td>

      <td>Background: Few data are reported in the literature about the outcome of patients with severe extended-spectrum ß-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) infections treated with cefolozane/tazobactam (C/T), in empiric or defnitive therapy. Methods: A multicenter retrospective study was performed in Italy (June 2016-June 2019). Successful clinical outcome was defined as complete resolution of clinical signs/symptoms related to ESBL-E infection and lack of microbiological evidence of infection. The primary end point was to identify predictors of clinical failure of C/T therapy. Results: C/T treatment was documented in 153 patients: pneumonia was the most common diagnosis (n = 46, 30%), followed by 34 cases of complicated urinary tract infections (22.2%). Septic shock was observed in 42 (27.5%) patients. C/T was used as empiric therapy in 46 (30%) patients and as monotherapy in 127 (83%) patients. Favorable clinical outcome was observed in 128 (83.7%) patients; 25 patients were considered to have failed C/T therapy. Overall, 30-day mortality was reported for 15 (9.8%) patients. At multivariate analysis, Charlson comorbidity index &gt;4 (odds ratio [OR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-3.5; P =.02), septic shock (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 3.8-7.9; P &lt;.001), and continuous renal replacement therapy (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.9-5.3; P =.001) were independently associated with clinical failure, whereas empiric therapy displaying in vitro activity (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.01-0.34; P &lt;.001) and adequate source control of infection (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.14-0.55; P &lt;.001) were associated with clinical success. Conclusions: Data show that C/T could be a valid option in empiric and/or targeted therapy in patients with severe infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of clinical failure with standard-dose C/T therapy in septic patients receiving CRRT.</td>

      <td>Abscesses of the head and neck region account for an important clinical problem. They are most frequently of dental origin (mainly due to carious changes or state after dental interventions), especially when located in the buccal region (about 1/3 cases). The correct diagnosis is the key to determine the proper treatment protocol: systemic antibiotics and/or surgical procedure (usually drainage) in order to prevent further progression of the inflammatory process (including transgression of the blood-brain barrier). Ultrasound is a sufficient first line diagnostic tool for the changes localized in the superficial spaces. Additionally, it is helpful in monitoring the effectiveness of the introduced treatment. Alternatively, MRI could be used, enabling more thorough 3D visualization of the affected areas and tissues differentiation, but due to its cost and availability its role is restricted, especially in monitoring (when examination needs to be repeated regularly). Below we would like to present a case report of our teenage patient, who developed idiopathic left-sided buccal abscess.</td>

      <td>Objectives: Hepatitis B is a viral infection that causes acute and chronic hepatitis and serious complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. Several psychiatric symptoms and depression, particularly anxiety, can be seen in patients. Evaluation of the relation between medication adherence and psychometric tests in patients with Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who are treated with oral antivirals is aimed in this study. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were included in this study. Sociodemographic data form, Morisky 8 scale, Beck Anxiety scale (BAS) and Beck Depression scale (BDS) have been applied to the patients. Results: The age of the patients vary from 17 to 80, average age of the patients is foud as 46.04. A hundred eleven of the patients were women (42.9%). Two hundred and seven patients had no sign of depression (79.9%) and 52 of the patients (20.1%) had depression. The drug compliance was low in patients whose BDS scores were decreased. It has been found out that 195 of the patients had lowgrade of anxiety (75.3%), 26 of the patients had midgrade of anxiety (10%), and 38 of the patients had high-grade of anxiety (14.7%). The medication adherence was low in patients whose BAS scores were decreased. Conclusion: Anxiety and depression are frequent in CHB patients. Therefore, CHB patients should be followed up psychiatrically and should be addressed to the psychiatry specialist when necessary. Depression and anxiety influences the drug compliance. Further studies are required for evaluation the relation between the medication adherence and the level of anxiety and depression in CHB patients.</td>

      <td>Objectives: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common among hemodialysis (HD) patients and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. New generation direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents are safe and effective in treatment HCV infection in HD patients. The aim of this a multi-center study was to assess the efficacy of DAAs in HD patients with HCV infection. Materials and Methods: HD patients with HCV infection followed-up at five centers were included in this retrospective cohort study. Patients demographic and virological characteristics, liver fibrosis status, end of treatment and sustained virologic responses (SVR12) at 12 weeks after treatment were recorded. Treatment of the patients was arranged according to the genotype and drug interactions considering guidelines. Results: Ninety percent of 20 patients were genotype 1b and were treated for 12 weeks with paritaprevir-ritonavir-ombitasvir-dasabuvir; one patient was genotype 4 and received PrOD + ribavirin (RBV) for 12 weeks; and one patient was genotype 3 and was treated with sofosbuvir + RBV for 24 weeks. HCV-RNA negativity was achieved in all patients at the end of treatment and SVR12 rate was 100%. Significant side effects were not observed in any patients, apart from sleeplessness in one patient and itching in another. Conclusion: Our real-life data support that new generation DAAs achieve high SVR and are well tolerated in HD patients with HCV. In these patients, intolerance and side effects were not observed, which would otherwise require cessation of the DAA regimen.</td>

We presented our experiences of treatment with PrOD in CHD patients. Materials and Methods: Between July 2016 and September 2018, a total of 25 CHD patients treated with PrOD were enrolled. The patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1a were treated with PrOD plus ribavirin (RBV) (12 or 24 weeks according to whether or not they had compensated cirrhosis), while the patients with genotype 1b were treated with PrOD alone. Liver functions, renal functions, and HCV-RNA levels were measured at baseline, 4, 12, and if applicable, 24 weeks after the initiation of treatment as well as 4 and 12 weeks after therapy. Results: Nineteen patients received PrOD, while 6 received PrOD plus RBV treatment. Two patients failed to complete the treatment. Two patients with compensated cirrhosis were treated over 24 weeks, while others received 12 weeks. In 23 patients completed 12 weeks, all were HCV-RNA negative at the end of the treatment, and had sustained virologic response (SVR) after the 12 weeks of treatment. The most common side effects were pruritus and anaemia. Conclusion: The PrOD treatment resulted in a high rate of SVR in HCV-infected CHD.</td>

      <td>Aim: In our country, where animal husbandry is widespread, we aimed to examine retrospectively data concerning childhood Brucellosis cases, which are not very high in the literature, which may occur with many variable clinical findings and may cause misdiagnosis and serious complications. Materials and Methods: The data of these patients with the diagnosis of Brucellosis who were treated between October 2016 and October 2018 in a Pediatric Clinic were retrospectively analyzed. For the diagnosis of Brucellosis in patients, the Wright agglutination test with complaints and clinical findings set at the titer being 1/160 or above was used. Results: In our study, the mean age of the patients was 7.4 years (3-15). 52.12% (n=37) were male and 47.88% (n=34) were female. All patients had a risk factor for Brucellosis infection. In 88.7% (n=63) of these patients, consumption of milk and dairy products (precipitates, fresh cheese was not cooked), and 11.3% (n=8) of raw meat (raw meatball) consumption and animal contact history were determined. Conclusion: Although early diagnosis and response to treatment with Brucellosis are very good, late diagnosis and inadequate treatment may cause mortality and morbidity with serious complications. Complaints of fatigue, weight loss and especially joint pain with long term fever should be evaluated by family physicians and pediatricians. The diagnosis of these patients should be kept in mind in the diagnosis of Brucellosis, an endemic disease common in our country.</td>

      <td>Aim: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the common infectious diseases of children. Due to the limited use of fluoroquinolones in children, they still have no resistance problems as seen in the adult population. However, recent reports suggested an increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones among bacteria causing UTI in children. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin and to detect mutations in their gyrA and parC genes. Materials and Methods: The present study is conducted on 78 bacterial strains isolated from children with UTI during 2016-2017 at Imam Reza Hospital in Kermanshah, Iran. The bacteria were identified based on microbiological methods and an antibiotic susceptibility test using disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods. Then, polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were performed to investigate mutations in the gyrA and parC genes. Results: Overall, 15.3% of isolates of E. coli and K. pneumonia were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Sequence analysis confirmed mutations in the gyrA and parC genes in all of the isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin. The results showed changes in amino acids (ser83leu, ser83phe and Asp87Asn) in codons 83 and 87 in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the gyrA gene, three substitutions in both the 80 and 84 positions in the parC, ser80Ile, Glu84val and Glu84lys genes. Conclusion: The results of this study revealed resistance to ciprofloxacin in the pediatric population. Given that the use of ciprofloxacin in children is limited, this resistance cannot be due to antibiotic selective pressure. On the other hand, the mutations in the gyrA and parC genes in children was similar to that in adults which indicate that these resistant isolates can be transmitted from adults to children.</td>

Although the comorbidity was excluded in DSM-IV (APA, 2000), DSM-5 (APA, 2013) does not preclude the concurrent diagnosis of ASD and ADHD (ASD+ADHD). This study aimed to understand distinctions in executive deficits among these conditions. We used analysis of reaction time (RT) and event-related potentials (ERP) during performance on oddball task with illusory figures. Participants were children (N = 18 per group) with ASD, ADHD, ASD+ADHD, and neurotypical controls (CNT). Analysis revealed that ASD and ASD+ADHD groups committed more errors and had higher omission error rates. Post-error RT in ASD and ASD+ADHD manifested as a post-error response speeding rather than normative RT slowing. The ASD and ASD+ADHD demonstrated an attenuated error-related negativity (ERN) as compared to ADHD and controls. The frontal N100 was enhanced to both target and nontarget figures in ASD and ASD+ADHD groups. Frontal ERPs had prolonged latencies in the ADHD as compared to other groups. The study confirmed the utility of using ERP to elucidate differences between ASD and ADHD and their impact in dual diagnosis. This information helps define the extent of overlap among these conditions both in terms of symptom expression and underlying neuropathology.</td>

      <td>The pathogen spectrum and resistance in patients with peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis: A single-center, observational clinical study</td>
      <td>Background: Peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis (PDAP) is one of the major causes of peritoneal dialysis (PD) failure and death. Therefore, it is important to determine how to effectively treat patients with PDAP. Materials and methods: We analyzed the pathogen spectrum and bacterial resistance in 203 PDAP cases that were enrolled in this study from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. All patients were infected with peritonitis and had been treated with antibiotics while at our center. Bacterial culture results of PD fluid and pathogen drug resistance were collected and analyzed. A total of 159 cases (78.3%) had a positive bacterial culture of PD fluid. Results: A total of 47 pathogens were identified, including 19 (40.4%) Gram-positive cocci strains (the most common was Staphylococcus spp.), 15 (31.9%) Gram-negative bacilli strains (the most common was Escherichia coli), 4 fungal strains, and 9 other strains. The drug sensitivity test showed that Gram-positive cocci were sensitive to vancomycin (94.9%), but had a high resistance to cefazolin (67.7%). Gram-negative bacilli were sensitive to imipenem (96.2%), but had a high resistance to ceftriaxone (60.0%). Voriconazole and itraconazole were sensitive in fungal infections. A total of 162 cases were cured, 37 cases were unresponsive to antibiotic treatment and converted to hemodialysis after Tenckhoff catheter removal, and 4 cases resulted in death. Conclusion: Gram-positive cocci are still the primary pathogen of PDAP cases in our center, but demonstrate a high resistance to first-generation cephalosporin, which is the suggested treatment per International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis 2016 Peritonitis Recommendations. Therefore, an individualized treatment based on the distribution of pathogens and drug resistance in different centers is more conducive to improve the cure rate of PDAP.</td>

      <td>Risk factors affecting complications due to prostate biopsy</td>
      <td>Objective: Currently, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy is the standard method used for prostate cancer detection. In the last decade, hospitalization due to complications has increased, especially due to infectious causes. Therefore, it is important to determine the risk factors affecting the complications of prostate biopsy. Materials and Methods: One hundred and sixty-four patients who underwent TRUS-guided prostate biopsy due to prostate cancer suspicion were included in our study. Patients' ages, total and free prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, prostate volumes, digital rectal examination findings, level of education, pathology results and pain related to the procedure were recorded. A 10-cm long visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the pain of the patients. Complications related to the procedure were questioned firstly on the same day and secondly during the visit of the patient for pathology. As a result of these evaluations, complications divided into three groups as none, minor (no intervention) and major (medically or surgically treated). Results: In our study, minor complications included rectal bleeding in 42 patients and hematuria lasting longer than 48 hours in 11 patients. Major complications were fever of &gt;38 °C in two patients and epididymitis in one patient. There was no statistically significant effect of age, total and free PSA, prostate volume, level of education, digital rectal examination findings and pathology results on complications. There was no statistically significant relationship between VAS pain score and rectal bleeding, hematuria, epididymitis. On the other hand, a statistically significant relationship was found between VAS pain score and fever. Conclusion: In the limited number of studies on the determination of risk factors for complications associated with prostate biopsy, the level of education, digital rectal examination findings, and pain due to the procedure were evaluated. In the light of our results, we believe that patients with high pain scores may be at risk for complications, especially for fever.</td>

      <td>Can serial measurement enhance the diagnostic value of procalcitonin as a marker of gram-negative bacteremia in children with acute leukemia?</td>
      <td>Aim: Despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment, infections are still major cause of morbidity and mortality in children with febrile neutropenia (FN). In these patients, due to inadequate inflammatory response and subtle clinical symptoms, to determine the source of infection can be challenging. Therefore, it is important to distinguish infections from other non-infectious causes, for both to choose appropriate antibiotic and to reduce the redundant antibiotic use. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, we aim to evaluate serial procalcitonin (PCT) levels for predicting bacteremia particularly caused by Gram-negative microorganism. Results: Among FN episodes caused by Gram-negative microorganism, the median level of second PCT sample obtained between 48 and 72 hours PCT 2 was found to be significantly higher when compared to infections caused by Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus or culture-negative confirmed infections, p value was 0.003; however, fever onset PCT 1 and C-reactive protein (CRP) 1 values showed no significant difference (p&gt;0.05). The area under curve values demonstrated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for CRP 1, CRP 2, PCT 1, PCT 2 were 0.664, 0.748, 0.504 and 0.842, respectively. Conclusion: This study showed that initial PCT levels were not significantly correlate with culture-confirmed bacterial infection. Therefore, initial PCT values do not help the clinicians in terms of administering or postponing empirical antibiotics at the time of fever onset. However, third day PCT levels present as a good diagnostic marker due to a higher sensitivity and specificity when comparing them to the initial values. Determination of serial PCT may enhance the diagnostic value of PCT diagnostic marker in FN episodes caused by Gram-negative bacteria with a high sensitivity (87.5%). This study also demonstrated that PCT could be used to rule out bacterial infections particularly caused by Gram-negative bacteria.</td>

      <td>Background: The isolation of antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus in freshwater fish poses a threat to public health because of the risk of human infections from consumption of such contaminated fish. Studies assessing antibiotic resistance of bacteria from body parts of fish and freshwater in Nigeria are sparse in the literature. This study therefore characterized S. aureus isolates from gills and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of catfish (Clarias gariepinus), and water samples from Jabi Lake, Nigeria Methodology: Over a period of three months (April to June 2018), gills and GIT samples of 30 fish, and water samples randomly collected from 6 sites of the Lake, were cultured on Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA) for the isolation of S. aureus. Standard biochemical tests were used for bacteria identification, and antibiogram of the isolates was determined by the disc diffusion method Results: The bacterial colony count in the gills (54.6±1.41 x 105 CFU/ml) and GIT (54.3±1.31 x 105 CFU/ml) was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) than the count from water sample (27.7±2.85 x 105 CFU/mL). S. aureus was isolated from 53% (16 of 30) of the gills, 57% (17 of 30) of the GIT, and 33% (2 of 6) of the water samples (p&lt;0.05). Ninety four point one percent of S. aureus recovered from gills were resistant to ampicillin while 53.3% from the GIT were resistant to levofloxacin. S. aureus from water samples were resistant (100%) to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, gentamycin, amoxicillin, rifampicin, erythromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin, and 50% were resistant to streptomycin and chloramphenicol Conclusion: The presence of antibiotic resistant S. aureus in this study may be the result of selective antimicrobial pressure from anthropogenic activities as a result of abuse and overuse of antimicrobials leading to residual antibiotics in the aquatic environment.</td>

      <td>Molecular characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates from a hospital in Ghana</td>
      <td>Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are a major cause of hospital- and community-acquired infection. They can colonize humans and cause a wide range of infections including pneumonia, endocarditis and bacteraemia. We investigated the molecular mechanism of resistance and virulence of MRSA isolates from a teaching hospital in Ghana. Methodology: A total of 91 S. aureus isolates constituted the initial bacterial sample. Identification of S. aureus was confirmed by the VITEK 2 system. The cefoxitin screen test was used to detect MRSA and antibiotic susceptibility was determined using the VITEK 2 system. The resistance (mecA, blaZ, aac-aph, ermC, and tetK) and virulence (lukS/F-PV, hla, hld and eta) genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and positive samples subjected to DNA sequencing. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to ascertain the relatedness of the isolates. Results: Fifty-eight of 91 (63.7%) isolates were putatively methicillin resistant by the phenotypic cefoxitin screen test and oxacillin MICs. However, 43 (47%) of the isolates were genotypically confirmed as MRSA based on PCR detection of the mecA gene. Furthermore, 37.9% of isolates displayed resistance to tetracycline, 19% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, 15.5% to clindamycin, 12.1% to gentamicin, 13.8% to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin, 6.9% to moxifloxacin and 7.0% to rifampicin. None of the isolates was positive for inducible clindamycin resistance. The prevalence of resistance (mecA, blaZ, aac(6')-aph(2''), tetK, and ermC) and virulence (hla and lukS/F-PV) genes respectively were 74%, 33%, 22%, 19%, 3%, 5% and 3%, with isolates organized in two highly related clades. Conclusion: Results indicate a fairly high occurrence of MRSA, which can complicate the effective therapy of S. aureus infections, necessitating surveillance and stringent infection control programmes to forestall its spread.</td>

      <td>Precision medicine is a patient-specific approach that integrates all relevant clinical, genetic and biological information in order to optimise the therapeutic benefit relative to the possibility of side-effects for each individual. Recent clinical trials have shown that higher blood eosinophil counts are associated with a greater efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Blood eosinophil counts are a biomarker with potential to be used in clinical practice, to help target ICS treatment with more precision in COPD patients with a history of exacerbations despite appropriate bronchodilator treatment. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2017 pharmacological treatment algorithms, based on the ABCD assessment, can be applied relatively easily to treatment-naive individuals at initial presentation. However, their use is more problematic during follow-up in patients who are already on maintenance treatment. There is a need for a different system to guide COPD pharmacological management during follow-up. Recent large randomised controlled trials have provided important new information concerning the therapeutic effects of ICSs and long-acting bronchodilators on exacerbations. The new evidence regarding blood eosinophils and inhaled treatments, and the need to distinguish between initial and follow-up pharmacological management, led to changes in the GOLD pharmacological treatment recommendations. This article explains the evidence and rationale for the GOLD 2019 pharmacological treatment recommendations.</td>

Medical history was negative except for Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. The examination evidenced a relative afferent pupillary defect in right eye and marked papillary oedema involving the macular region. Brain and orbits magnetic resonance imaging were normal, and fundoscopy showed star-shaped hard exudates. Autoimmune and infective screening revealed IgM and IgG antibodies against Bartonella henselae, suggesting for recent cat-scratch disease. She was treated with high-dose intravenous steroids and doxycycline. One month later she fully recovered, and she had no relapses. We diagnosed a Bartonella henselae neuroretinitis (finally the patient recalled she had stroked stray cats, not being scratched). In conclusion time course and absence of pain differentiate neuroretinitis from other optic neuropathies. Fundoscopic image of macular star is a clue for diagnosis, and visual recovery is usually excellent.</td>

      <td>Background: Parafalcine subdural empyema (SDE) is a rare entity consisting of pus accumulating below the longitudinal sinus, between the falx cerebri and the arachnoid layer covering the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere. Its treatment strategy is controversial, but most clinicians have the general belief that appropriate treatment consists of prompt surgery combined with long-term antibiotic therapy. Nevertheless, six reports published in the 1980s provided evidence that antibiotic therapy alone is a safe and suitable option. The treatment strategies and outcomes of the 31 well-described cases previously published, in addition to our own, are discussed. Case Description: We report a 21-year-old female with a right-side parafalcine SDE who presented with fever, headache, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and contralateral hemiparesis 3 weeks after undergoing sinonasal surgery. Despite clinical symptoms almost entirely abating after starting treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, magnetic resonance imaging performed during the 2(nd) and 3(rd) weeks showed progressive enlargement of the interhemispheric collection (from 4 cm(3) to 30 cm(3)). We reflect on the treatment strategy chosen for this patient, who experienced a total recovery. Conclusion: A nonsurgical strategy for parafalcine SDE might be contemplated for patients with a good clinical condition and no major midline shift on neuroradiological studies, given their usual indolent course and the relative difficulty in reaching the interhemispheric fissure. Conversely, surgery should be contemplated when the collection significantly enlarges despite antibiotic therapy. When surgical drainage is added to antibiotics, broad-range 16S ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction of the empyema is recommended to identify the causative organism as pus cultures are usually sterile.</td>

She underwent laminectomy at two separate thoracic levels; this involved excision of the upper T4–T6, and just exploration of the lower T9–T11 lesions. One year postoperatively, she exhibited a residual paraparesis. Conclusion: Spinal NCC must be considered among the differential diagnostic considerations for patients presenting with spinal intramedullary or subarachnoid/extramedullary cystic lesions. Although they are typically found in endemic regions, those who have traveled to these locations are also susceptible. Even though it is considered a benign condition, spinal NCC may cause permanent and irreversible neurological damage. Public health policies should, therefore, be developed to help control the spread and transmission of NCC.</td>

Her magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed osteomyelitis involving the T4 vertebral body with epidural and prevertebral extension; notably, the intervertebral disc spaces were not involved. Although the fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination was inconclusive, the patient was empirically placed on antitubercular drug therapy. One month later, she became fully paraplegic. The MRI now demonstrated osteolytic lesions involving the T4 vertebral body with cord compression. She underwent biopsy of the T4 vertebral body and a transfacet T4 decompression with T2-T6 pedicle screw fixation. Culture and histopathological examinations both documented a cryptococcal infection, and she was placed on appropriate antifungal therapy. Notably, 3 weeks after surgery, she developed a sudden loss of vision loss due to retinal fungal endophthalmitis. She recovered vision in one eye after the administration of intravitreal voriconazole but lost vision in the other eye despite a vitrectomy. Over the next 8 months, she gradually recovered with motor function of 4/5 in both lower extremities without evidence of recurrent disease. Conclusion: Cryptococcal infection should be among the differential diagnostic considerations for patients with vertebral osteomyelitis. Notably, diagnostic delay can lead to devastating neurological deficits and involvement of other organ systems.</td>

      <td>Background: Infections from Coxiella burnetii, resulting in what is known as Q fever, are relatively rare and difficult to diagnose. Very few reports of spinal infection from C. burnetii have been reported rarely have these cases required surgical intervention. Case Description: We report a patient with the previous vascular surgery and Q fever spinal osteomyelitis. Previously reported cases with spinal involvement have described initial infection of vascular grafts in proximity to the spine. Literature on spinal infection from C. burnetii reports only one case that required surgical intervention of the spine. We report a patient with L5-S1 diskitis who required surgical intervention and subsequent percutaneous drainage. Conclusion: Spinal infections from C. burnetii are rare; however, in the setting of a patient with osteodiscitis with negative cultures as well as a history of significant vascular disease with stents, the diagnosis of Q fever should be entertained. Operative and interventional procedures should also be considered in these patients to help alleviate pain and maintain neurologic function.</td>

      <td>Introduction. Colistin is a last-resort antibiotic used against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (AB); however, colistin resistance has been reported recently. Methylene blue (MB) is used in microbiology for staining, and in medicine as an antidote drug. Aim. We aimed to investigate the antimicrobial effects of MB and eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar against colistin-resistant AB strains. Methodology. Firstly, a standard strain and AB clinical isolate were included in the study. After determining MICs, two strains were transformed into colistin-resistant forms, using Li's method. At each step, new MICs were determined and subcultures were inoculated onto EMB and sheep blood agar (SBA). Colistin MICs of the subcultures were also determined using Mueller–Hinton agar (MHA) containing MB. Secondly, colistin-resistant clones from 31 multidrug-resistant AB clinical isolates were screened to investigate their susceptibilities to EMB agar. Results. In the first round, MICs of both strains had risen to 64 μg ml(−1). Subpopulations with high colistin resistance were inhibited by MB and EMB agar, but could grow well on SBA. In MHA plates containing MB, the MICs decreased to 0.5 μg ml(−1) for colistin-susceptible or moderately resistant clones. Additionally, clones with high colistin resistance showed atypical colony morphology on SBA. In the second round, 35% of the clinical isolates, which had gained resistance to colistin, were inhibited by EMB agar. Conclusion. MB may have inhibitory effects against colistin-resistant AB. Secondly, using only EMB agar for subculturing may cause missing of colistin-resistant strains.</td>

      <td>The spread of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a public health concern. The inducible macrolide–lincosamide–streptogrammin B (iMLS(B) ) phenotype (or inducible clindamycin resistance) is associated with false clindamycin susceptibility in routine laboratory testing and may lead to treatment failure. Tigecycline resistance remains rare in S. aureus worldwide. This study aims to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of clinical isolates of S. aureus obtained from the main tertiary hospital in Terengganu state, Malaysia, from July 2016 to June 2017. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of 90 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 109 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were determined by disc diffusion with the iMLS(B) phenotype determined by D-test. Multidrug resistance (MDR) and the iMLS(B) phenotype were more prevalent in MRSA (84.4 and 46.7 %, respectively) compared to MSSA isolates. All five tigecycline-resistant isolates were MRSA. The high incidence of MDR and the iMLS(B) phenotype and the emergence of tigecycline resistance in the Terengganu S. aureus isolates warrants continuous vigilance.</td>

      <td>Breakthrough bloodstream infections in critically ill non-neutropenic patients: higher incidence and better survival than non-breakthrough infections</td>
      <td>Introduction. Breakthrough bloodstream infections (BSIs) are rare among non-neutropenic patients. Aim. Our goal was to determine the risk factors associated with development of breakthrough BSIs among critically ill non-neutropenic patients and its role in mortality. Methodology. During a 24-month period (August 2016 to July 2018), all BSIs among non-neutropenic patients hospitalized at the University General Hospital of Patras, Greece, were included. Antimicrobial resistance of isolates was interpreted according to EUCAST guidelines. BSIs were considered as breakthrough when blood cultures yielded a pathogen in a patient who, for at least the previous 72 h, had been receiving at least one antibiotic to which the isolated microorganism was susceptible. Results. Among 217 episodes of BSI, 118 (54.4%) developed a breakthrough infection. Primary BSIs predominated (101; 46.5 %), followed by catheter-related BSIs (56; 25.8 %). Gram-negative bacteria represented the most common pathogens isolated (157; 72.4 %), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (36; 16.6 %) and fungi (36; 16.6 %). Factors independently associated with the development of breakthrough BSIs were immunosuppressive therapy, obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg m(−2)), infection by Gram-positive bacteria, noradrenaline dose during 24 h from BSI onset, prior use of colistin and antifungal treatment. Overall 14-day mortality was 23.0% (50 patients). Multivariate analysis revealed noradrenaline dose during 24 h from BSI onset as an independent predictor of mortality, while appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment and breakthrough BSI were identified as predictors of good prognosis. Conclusion. Breakthrough BSIs were common among critically ill non-neutropenic patients and these patients were associated with better survival because they were de facto receiving appropriate antibiotics.</td>

      <td>Surveillance cultures for detection of rectal and lower respiratory tract carriage of colistin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in intensive care unit patients: comparison of direct plating and pre-enrichment step</td>
      <td>Purpose. Increasing consumption of colistin as treatment for infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) has been accompanied by increasingly frequent reports of colistin-resistant (ColR) MDR GNB. Higher selective pressure creates a favourable environment that can facilitate the spread of ColR isolates. Monitoring of asymptomatic ColR GNB carriage can give us a better understanding of this emerging healthcare problem, particularly in wards with higher polymyxin selective pressure and prevalence of carbapenem-resistant GNB. Our aim was to assess the ColR GNB colonization rate in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and evaluate the performance of two surveillance protocols using a selective medium. Methodology. A prospective study included 739 surveillance samples (rectal swabs and tracheal aspirates) from 330 patients that were screened for ColR GNB carriage using SuperPolymyxin medium. Two approaches were used: direct sample plating and overnight pre-enrichment of samples followed by plating. Colistin resistance was confirmed with broth microdilution. ColR isolates were molecularly screened for plasmid-mediated mcr genes. Results. A total of 44/739 samples (45 ColR GNB isolates) were positive for ColR GNB, which included 31/330 (9.4%) colonized patients; mcr genes were not detected. The direct plating method only identified 17/45 (37.8%) isolates correctly, whereas the pre-enrichment protocol identified all 45 ColR GNB. Conclusion. The colonization rate among our ICU patients was 9.4 %. Based on our findings, the pre-enrichment step is necessary for the determination of ColR GNB carriage – even though the time to result takes an additional day, fewer than half of ColR GNB carriers were detected using the direct plating protocol.</td>

      <td>In Western Europe, the incidence of both respiratory and cutaneous diphtheria, caused by toxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Corynebacterium ulcerans or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, has been low over the past few decades thanks to the use of an effective vaccine and a high level of vaccination coverage. However, the disease has still not been eradicated and continues to occur in all of Europe. In order to prevent sequelae or a fatal outcome, diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) should be administered to suspected diphtheria patients as soon as possible, but economic factors and issues concerning regulations have led to poor availability of DAT in many countries. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and World Health Organization have called for European Union-wide solutions to this DAT-shortage. In order to illustrate the importance of these efforts and underline the need for continued diphtheria surveillance, we present data on all registered cases of toxigenic and non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae, C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis in Belgium during the past decade, up to and including 2017.</td>

      <td>Candida auris: a comparison between planktonic and biofilm susceptibility to antifungal drugs</td>
      <td>Introduction. Candida auris is a pathogenic yeast that mainly affects immunosuppressed patients and those with implanted medical devices. This pathogen also displays elevated resistance to common antifungals and high survival and spreading capacities. Since no antifungal breakpoints have yet been defined for this pathogen, the data obtained here can be useful for further research concerning treatment or implementation of a prevention and disinfection protocol. Our aim was to study the antifungal resistance of C. auris to current antifungals in planktonic and sessile states. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy and viable biomass production, we demonstrated the ability of C. auris to develop a mature biofilm. We compared the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) for the C. auris DSM 21092 strain plus two clinical isolates, and the results were compared with those obtained for Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis, two species strongly linked to bloodstream infections and infections associated with biomaterials. We found that the clinical isolates of C. auris were resistant to fluconazole and sensitive to echinocandins and polyenes. The C. auris biofilms did not show susceptibility to any antifungal agent, showing MBECs that were up to 512-fold higher than the MICs. These findings highlight the importance of biofilm formation as a key factor underlying the resistance of this species to antifungals and suggest that the presence of implantable medical devices is one of the major risk factors in immunocompromised patients.</td>

      <td>Introduction. Among beta-haemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) is the prototype agent of bacterial pharyngitis and causes other human infections. Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE) causes GAS-like infections, while Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) is a common neonate pathogen that is rarely associated with pharyngitis. Aim. To determine the prevalence and persistence of beta-haemolytic streptococci throat carriage and type the bacterial population. Methods. Throat swabs were collected from 121 children and 127 young adult volunteers and cultured. Colonized volunteers were screened quarterly, for up to 1 year, while beta-haemolytic streptococci could be detected. Isolates were identified and submitted to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and epidemiological typing. Results. Carriage was detected in 34 (13.7 %) volunteers. Seventeen children carried GAS (14 %), while 17 young adults carried SDSE (8, 6.3 %), GBS (4, 3.1 %), GAS (3, 2.4 %) and the Streptococcus anginosus group (2, 1.6 %). Persistent carriage was detected for up to 6 months in two children and for up to 1 year in three young adults. Three new emm subtypes were found, emm87.16 and emm90.9 (GAS) and stC36.11 (SDSE). While the GAS population among children was unexpectedly clonal, substantial genetic diversity was found among the isolates recovered from young adults. Resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline was detected in GAS, GBS and SDSE recovered from young adults. Conclusions. Prevalence was slightly greater among children, but persistent carriage was greater among young adults, with SDSE being the species most associated with persistence. Few sources seemed to disseminate GAS among children, since only two clonal types were found. The volunteers hosted pathogenic streptococci persistently, including macrolide-resistant strains.</td>

This bacterium is a Gram+coccus, catalase+, coagulase, and it is a common inhabitant of skin and oral mucosa. Aim. To investigate the spectrum of infections caused by K. Kristinae. Methodology. Between January–March 2018, we carried out a systematic search in PubMed utilizing the key search term ‘Kocuria kristinae’. The selection criteria for studies were studies reporting cases of human infections due to K. kristinae, case-control and cohort studies and studies published in English or Spanish. Results. The literature search yielded 48 publications: after title, abstract and full-text analysis, 20 papers were consistent with the selection criteria. These studies were carried out in the period 2001–2017 in the USA, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Ukraine, Egypt, Bahrain, Serbia, India, Italy, Spain, Turkey and Mexico. K. kristinae was involved in 17 cases of central venous catheter-related bacteremia, four infective endocarditis, three acute peritonitis, one abdominal abscess, umbilical sepsis, acute cholecystitis and urinary tract infection. Additionally, K. kristinae was found in 40 % of carious cavities, although it is not clear whether they are directly involved in the development of caries. Antibiotic susceptibility testing has sometimes revealed multidrug resistance. Conclusions. The clinical spectrum of K. kristinae infections has recently widened. The increasing spread of this underestimated bacterium and its resistance to antibiotics represent a new challenge for public health, which requires specific actions to limit it.</td>

However, indwelling catheters have been associated with a substantial risk of urinary tract infection (UTI). The purpose of this study was to (1) evaluate the incidence of UTI and POUR in patient with indwelling urinary catheter after TJA, (2) identify the microorganisms responsible for catheter colonization, and (3) assess preoperative risk factors (gender, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking) associated with catheter colonization. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing primary TJA with no preoperative bacteriuria were enrolled. Prior to the draping of the surgical site, each patient received an indwelling catheter that was inserted under sterile conditions and remained in place for 24 hours. Urine and tip catheter cultures were performed after catheter removal. RESULTS: 55 patients (38 females and 17 males) were recruited (26 total knee and 29 total hip arthroplasties). POUR was not reported in any patient, and only 1 patient (1.8%) had UTI. Cultures of catheter tips were positive in 16 patients (29.1%). Only 1 of these patients had a positive urine culture. Enterococcus faecalis was the most common pathogen isolated. None of the preoperative variables was associated with the risk of catheter colonization. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study support early catheter removal after TJA. Predominant catheter-isolated bacteria are enteric species. The culture of a catheter tip specimen should be discouraged for the diagnosis of UTI within the firsts 24 hours after surgery.</td>

The two-step procedure allows the surgeon to eliminate the infected tissues and then to promote new bone formation. We analyzed the literature about the use of the induced membrane technique in osteomyelitis and the innovations recently suggested. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed some of the most common web databases using the key-words: Masquelet technique, induced membrane, and osteomyelitis. 66 studies were analyzed. RESULTS: Comparing the Masquelet technique to other surgical procedures it shows better functional results in large bone defects due to infection. The induced membrane is like a biological chamber that protects the autograft and induces new bone formation promoting growth factors secretion. Different authors tried to improve one or more steps of the surgical procedure. Some studies focused on polymethyl methacrylate role and the possibility to use different materials instead of cement to induce the membrane. Others analyzed the autograft harvesting and placing techniques trying to reduce the amount of bone essential to fill the gap, like the RIA technique. Moreover, bone substitutes have been used, as beta-tricalcium phosphate, that showed an osteoconductive ability. CONCLUSIONS: The survey is not a systematic review.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of linezolid in the treatment of PNSI caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS). Methods: We conducted an observational study for all patients over 14 years old and diagnosed with MRS PNSI. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory information were collected prospectively. Results: A total of 10 patients with PNSI (6 meningitis, 2 ventriculitis, and 2 subdural empyema) received linezolid. MRS isolated was Staphylococcus aureus in seven cases and Staphylococcus epidermidis in three cases. All isolated microorganisms were susceptible to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 2 mg/L) and linezolid (MIC = 1). The rate of microbiologic efficacy was 100% for patients with meningitis or ventriculitis. In the case of subdural empyema, focal infection had improved between 14 and 18 days. No adverse effects occurred during this study. Conclusion: Our results suggest that linezolid as an alternative to vancomycin for the treatment of PNSI caused by MRS with a high rate of efficacy.</td>

      <td>Infectious diseases induced by drug-resistant bacteria are one of the major problems in clinical practice. In the ongoing scenario, where the resistant bacteria are spreading widely and limited options for treatment are presently available with antimicrobial agents. The study was conducted to determine antibacterial potential of Manuka honey (MH)BV20+ joint at different strength against extended spectrum beta lactamases (esbl) producing bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia (n = 30 for all isolates). Resistance pattern along with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were analysed. From thirty clinical isolates each of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, no one showed resistance against manuka honey even at 4000 µL/mL dilution but twelve samples of Escherichia coli and ten samples of Klebsiella pneumonia showed resistance against Ciprofloxacin, used as positive control. The average zone of inhibition of Ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli was 24.14 mm, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa it was 26.38 mm and 25.14 mm for Klebsiella pneumoniae while the average zone of inhibition of undiluted manuka honey against Escherichia coli was 29.38 mm, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa it was 28.22 mm and 25.21 mm for Klebsiella pneumoniae. MIC and MBC were found to be 4000 µL/mL against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa while for Klebsiella pneumonia it was 5000 µL/mL. Manuka honey BV20+ joint showed an excellent antibacterial potential against resistant strains of extended spectrum beta lactamases bacteria indicating its significance in clinical practice.</td>

Fecal samples (n = 113) were collected randomly from cattle at different localities in Sharkia Governate between September 2016 and August 2018. Samples were then examined parasitologically. Overall, GIN were found in 21 (18.6%) of the samples, the highest GIN prevalence was observed in winter (25.6%), while the lowest prevalence was in summer (10.3%). Adult cattle (42.9%) showed higher GIN infection than young calves (23.8%). Further, most of the infected cattle (92.4%) showed a light intensity of infection with GIN. The coproculture of infected fecal samples reveled that, 15 (71.4%) samples have single infection and 6 (28.6%) samples have mixed infection and Trichostrongylus spp. (41.9%) were the most frequently observed GIN, followed by Strongyloides spp. (35.2%), whereas, Cooperia spp. (8.7%) was the less frequently observed GIN. No significant difference (P = 0.78) was observed between using albendazole and allicin for treatment of GIN in cattle. The current study provides new and updated results that may help in the effort to control GIN. Also, this study shows that allicin could be used for treatment and control of GIN in cattle. However, further investigations in the efficacy of allicin in treatment of GIN in cattle and actual dose, are warranted.</td>

      <td>Therapy of peripartum mental disorders</td>
      <td>During the peripartum period, women are at a greater risk of developing a mental disorder or experiencing an exacerbation of the pre-existing mental disorders. Therapeutic interventions are based primarily on psychotherapy, but if the symptoms are severe and pose a risk to the mother and the child, then the use of drugs, hospitalization or electroconvulsive therapy is considered. Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy is the first line of treatment in postpartum blues and postpartum depression, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and mild to moderate obsessive-compulsive disorder. More recent conceptions regarding the use of drugs during the postpartum period indicate that medications should be prescribed if the risk of using them is lower than the risk of complications caused by the symptoms of mental disorders. Nortriptyline or desipramine are recommended from the group of tricyclic antidepressants, but newer generation antidepressants are shown to be safer during pregnancy. Fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline can be used in postpartum period during breastfeeding, while fluoxetine and citalopram should be avoided. The use of first-generation antipsychotics haloperidol and trifluoperazine is recommended in the antepartum period, during which some of second-generation antipsychotics such as quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone and aripiprazole can also be used. Clozapine should be avoided during breast-feeding. The use of mood stabilizers during pregnancy requires a thorough knowledge of the recommendations, and it is not advised to use them during the postpartum if the patient is breastfeeding. From the group of benzodiazepines, it is recommended to uselorazepam. Every form of therapeutic approach has proven to be more effective in the presence of emotional support from partners and other family members.</td>

Dyspnea in pregnancy is common but might represent underlying pathology. While an obstetrician is knowledgeable of physiologic pregnancy changes, he or she should remain vigilant for underlying pathologic causes of dyspnea, including malignancy.

A qualitative design using semistructured interviews was used. Interviews were recorded, translated, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. A total of 75 vendors, representing 85% of the outlets in the study area, were interviewed. Most of the vendors were associated with a drug shop type of outfit. About three-quarters reported having completed some level of postsecondary education, but just one-tenth of the vendors had qualifications that made them eligible to apply for a license to operate a drug shop. While most outlets stocked at least one type of antimalarial, only about one-quarter stocked an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), one-quarter expressed a preference for ACTs, and less than one-tenth attested to firmly adhering to the national malaria treatment guidelines on dispensing ACTs as the first-line option. In contrast, nine out of 10 vendors stocked quinine and well over a third stocked antimalarials no longer recommended, such as chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. Given the ongoing gap between the national malaria policy and unlicensed drug outlet practices, this study calls for greater engagement of unlicensed vendors to improve the management of childhood malaria.</td>

They cause great suffering and are transmitted directly or indirectly between animals and humans and circulate in the global environment. E. coli are among them, causing a major public health problem. The aim of this study was therefore to study the antimicrobial resistance profile of E. coli from raw cow milk and fruit juice. Materials and Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2016 to June 2017 on 258 samples collected from milk shops (n=86), dairy farms (n=86), and fruit juice (n=86) in different subcities of Mekelle. Bacteriological procedures were used for isolation of E. coli in the collected samples and for identification of the antimicrobial resistance profile. Result. The overall mean viable bacterial count and standard deviation of samples from milk shop, fruit juice, and dairy milk were found to be 8.86 ± 107, 7.2 ± 107, and 8.65 ± 107 CFU/ml and 33.87 ± 106, 6.68 ± 106, and 22.0 ± 106, respectively. Of the samples tested, 39 from milk shops (45.35%), 20 from fruit juice (23.26%), and 24 from dairy farms (27.91%) were found to be positive for E. coli. The isolated E. coli were highly resistant to ampicillin (70%), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (60%), clindamycin (80%), erythromycin (60%), chloramphenicol (50%), and kanamycin (50%) and were found to be susceptible to some antibiotics like gentamicin (100%), norfloxacin (100%), tetracycline (60%), polymyxin B (90%), and ciprofloxacin (90%). Conclusion. The current study supports the finding that raw milk and fruit juice can be regarded as critical source of pathogenic E. coli. This supports the need for strict monitoring and the implementation of effective hygienic and biosecurity measures in the whole food chain of these products as well as a prudent use of antimicrobials.</td>

      <td>In order to contribute to the fight against infectious diseases, the in vitro antibacterial activity and the antibiotic-potentiating effects of Tristemma hirtum and five other Cameroonian edible plants have been evaluated against Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes. The microdilution method was used to evaluate the bacterial susceptibility of the extracts and their combination to common antibiotics. The phytochemical screening of the extracts was carried out according to standard methods. Phytochemical analysis of the extracts revealed the presence of alkaloids, triterpenes, steroids, and polyphenols, including flavonoids in most of the tested extracts. The entire tested extracts showed moderate (512 μg/mL ≤ MIC ≤ 2048 μg/mL) to weak (MIC &gt; 2048 μg/mL) antibacterial activities against the tested bacteria. Furthermore, extracts of leaf of Tristemma hirtum and pericarps of Raphia hookeri (at their MIC/2 and MIC/4) strongly potentiated the activities of all antibiotics used in the study, especially those of chloramphenicol (CHL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), kanamycin (KAN), and tetracycline (TET) against 70% (7/10) to 100% (10/10) of the tested MDR bacteria, with the modulating factors ranging from 2 to 128. The results of this study suggest that extracts from leaves of Tristemma hirtum and pericarps of Raphia hookeri can be sources of plant-derived products with antibiotic modifying activity.</td>

Prognosis of therapy results of patients with the juvenile idiopatic arthritis (JIA) without systematic manifestations is the precondition of their treatment efficiency enhancement. Objective. Our aim was to establish early predictors for remission achievement in patients with JIA without systematic manifestations who received Etanercept therapy. Methods. The therapy results of patients with JIA without systematic manifestations hospitalized from December, 2009 to August, 2014 and administrated with Etanercept are analysed. The association of initial demographic indicators as well as initial and registered after a month of treatment clinical and laboratory indicators with remission achievement after a year of treatment according to the Wallace criteria is estimated. Results. The research included 197 patients with JIA without systematic manifestations who received Etanercept in 0.4 mg/kg dose twice a week subcutaneously (the maximum single dose ― 25 mg). In addition to Etanercept 136 (69%) patients received Methotrexat, 121 (61%) ― non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 10 (5%) ― glucocorticosteroids, 6 (3%) ― Sulfasalazine. After a year of treatment remission was recorded in 77 out of 197 (39.1%) patients. According to multivariate analysis the remission predictors are the following: tender joint count ≤ 4 (odds ratio (OR) 4.38; 95% confidential interval (CI) 2.33−8.55), duration of illness before Etanercept therapy ≤ 2 years (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.02–2.15), disease activity decline according to JADAS71 index ≥ 10 points in a month of the therapy including Etanercept (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.38−5.03). Model sensitivity was 32% (all three criteria in 25/77 patients with remission), specificity ― 94% (lack of even one criteria in 113/120 patients who did not achieve remission). Conclusion. The predictors of remission in patients with JIA without systematic manifestations in 1 year of Etanercept therapy are smaller tender joint count prior to therapy, smaller duration of illness as well as significant disease activity decline in a month of the therapy.</td>

Oral minocycline and topical steroid treatment produced no improvement. With a reduction in the gefitinib dosage, alopecia gradually improved, although scarring remained. We consider these trichoscopic findings and suspect that follicular keratotic plugging might be a finding associated with scarring alopecia due to EGFR inhibitor therapy.</td>

      <td>Ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab represent a new class of immunotherapeutic drugs for treating patients with advanced cancer. Known as checkpoint inhibitors, these drugs act to upregulate the cellular and humoral immune response to tumor antigens by inhibiting T-cell autoregulation. As a consequence, they can be associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to loss of self-tolerance, including rare cases of immune-related cytopenias. We performed a retrospective clinical chart review, including serologic, hematology, and chemistry laboratory results, of two patients who developed red blood cell (RBC) autoantibodies during treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. Serologic testing of blood samples from these patients during induction therapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, respectively, showed their RBCs to be positive by the direct antiglobulin test (IgG+, C3+) and their plasma to contain panreactive RBC autoantibodies. Neither patient had evidence of hemolysis. Both patients developed an additional irAE during treatment. A literature review for patients who had developed immune-mediated cytopenia following treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor was performed. Nine other patients were reported with a hematologic irAE, including six with anemia attributable to autoimmune anemia, aplastic anemia, or pure RBC aplasia. Hematologic irAEs tend to occur early during induction therapy, often coincident with irAEs of other organs. In conclusion, checkpoint inhibitors can be associated with the development of autoantibodies, immune-mediated cytopenias, pure RBC aplasia, and aplastic anemia. Immunohematology reference laboratories should be aware of these agents when evaluating patients with advanced cancer and new-onset autoantibodies, anemia, and other cytopenias.

      <td>Here we have explored whether inhibition of autophagy can be used as a treatment strategy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Steady-state autophagy was measured in leukemic cell lines and primary human CD34(+) AML cells with a large variability in basal autophagy between AMLs observed. The autophagy flux was higher in AMLs classified as poor risk, which are frequently associated with TP53 mutations (TP53(mut)), compared with favorable-and intermediate-risk AMLs. In addition, the higher flux was associated with a higher expression level of several autophagy genes, but was not affected by alterations in p53 expression by knocking down p53 or overexpression of wild-type p53 or p53(R273H). AML CD34(+) cells were more sensitive to the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) than normal bone marrow CD34(+) cells. Similar, inhibition of autophagy by knockdown of ATG5 or ATG7 triggered apoptosis, which coincided with increased expression of p53. In contrast to wild-type p53 AML (TP53(wt)), HCQ treatment did not trigger a BAX and PUMA-dependent apoptotic response in AMLs harboring TP53(mut). To further characterize autophagy in the leukemic stem cell-enriched cell fraction AML CD34(+) cells were separated into ROS(low) and ROS(high) subfractions. The immature AML CD34(+)-enriched ROS(low) cells maintained higher basal autophagy and showed reduced survival upon HCQ treatment compared with ROS(high) cells. Finally, knockdown of ATG5 inhibits in vivo maintenance of AML CD34(+) cells in NSG mice. These results indicate that targeting autophagy might provide new therapeutic options for treatment of AML since it affects the immature AML subfraction.</td>

      <td>Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (hereafter referred to as PI3-kinases) are lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3′-hydroxyl group of inositol lipids. The generated phospholipids are critical signaling molecules that recruit proteins to specific intracellular membranes leading to localized activation of these proteins. PI3-kinases regulate many cellular activities, and are closely linked to human diseases, including cancer. One molecular event regulated by PI3-kinases is autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved membrane trafficking process that degrades and recycles cellular constituents to maintain cell and tissue homeostasis. Over the past two decades, our understanding of PI3-kinases has progressed from pan-PI3-kinase inhibitor studies to isoform-specific genetic knockout and systems biology interactome analyses. Our view of autophagy has emerged from unicellular yeast vesicle trafficking to mammalian physiology and human diseases. In this chapter we summarize the major discoveries on autophagy regulation by PI3-kinases and discuss the therapeutic potentials of targeting PI3-kinases in modulating autophagy and in cancer therapy.</td>

      <td>Severe, Persistent and Fatal Delirium in Psychogeriatric Patients Admitted to a Psychiatric Hospital</td>
      <td>Background/Aims: Although delirium is generally regarded as a transient syndrome, persistence of delirium in patients with cognitive impairment - even with fatal outcome - has been reported as well. This study aims to describe the clinical features and neuropathological correlates of this type of delirium. Methods: Inclusion criteria for this case series were: (1) severe persistent delirium until death, (2) history of cognitive decline and (3) consent for brain autopsy. Medical records were examined in combination with collected clinical data and neuropathological findings. Result: In 15 patients, all living at home before admission, episodes with delirium lasted for 4.2 months on average. No distinct medical causes of persistent delirium could be identified. Pathological diagnoses included Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies as well as single cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Conclusion: Severe, persistent and fatal delirium in patients with cognitive impairment can occur relatively early in the disease trajectory and is associated with diverse neuropathologies.</td>

      <td>Unilateral Conjunctival in situ Squamous Carcinoma with Bilateral Conjunctival Chlorpromazine-Induced Secondary Melanosis Masquerading as in situ and Invasive Melanoma</td>
      <td>Purpose: To describe the clinical and histopathological features of a 61-year-old male with a history of eczema, asthma and schizophrenia on long-term chlorpromazine medication, who developed a unilateral limbal tumour in association with bilateral melanosis. Procedures: The patient was referred for a routine cataract assessment, and an incidental pink gelatinous limbal lesion was detected on the left side, associated with bilateral speckled brown conjunctival pigmentation. The limbal lesion and brown pigmentation were biopsied. The tissue was fixed in standard buffered formalin and processed to paraffin wax, and sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Tissue from the pigmented area was also processed for transmission electron microscopy. Results: The biopsy from the limbal lesion showed an in situ squamous carcinoma associated with prominent numbers of intra-epithelial eosinophils. The biopsy of the pigmented area showed bilateral melanosis without atypia. The latter was attributable to an increase in melanin production rather than to melanocyte hyperplasia. Melanophages were also present in the adjacent substantia propria. These pigment changes were entirely compatible with chlorpromazine-induced secondary melanosis. Conclusions: This paper highlights the first documented occurrence of in situ squamous carcinoma with bilateral chlorpromazine-induced conjunctival secondary melanosis. This clinically masqueraded as in situ melanoma/primary acquired melanosis and invasive melanoma. Bilateral melanosis is rare, has many causes and, in this case, was drug induced. This highlights the importance of thorough history taking and illustrates that not all pigmented and amelanotic lesions are in situ melanomas, primary acquired melanosis or invasive melanomas. Lastly, atopy was a risk factor for the development of this in situ squamous carcinoma.</td>

      <td>Late Recurrent Testicular Seminoma: Histological Evidence Is Required</td>
      <td>Introduction: Over the past 3 decades, the appropriate management of metastatic germ cell tumours (GCT) has been defined by several phase III trials. Many follow-up recommendations have been published based on expert consensus. However, common clinical scenarios can still be vexing for clinicians who are less experienced at managing patients with testicular cancer. Case Report: We highlight the arduous diagnostic work-up of a suspected late relapsing metastatic GCT in a patient suffering from fatigue, weight loss and prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes, 4 years after first-line chemotherapy for metastatic seminoma. The various explorations finally led to the diagnosis of Whipple's disease. Conclusion: This unusual clinical case strongly highlights the need to perform an exhaustive evaluation, with a biopsy, if a late recurrent GCT is suspected to avoid pointless and potentially harmful treatment.</td>

      <td>Neurologic complications of organ transplantation</td>
      <td>•Over the past four decades, remarkable advances have been made in the field of organ transplantation. Improved surgical techniques and perioperative care have reduced the mortality and morbidity of many organ transplant procedures to acceptable levels. The creation of national and international organ registries has resulted in a more efficient system for organ procurement and use. Advances in immunology and the introduction of more potent immunomodulating agents have led to doubling of survival rates for those with transplanted grafts.•Unfortunately, a high rate of neurologic complications associated with organ transplantation persists. Cerebral embolization, hypoxia, and bleeding remain frequent after heart and lung transplantation. Prolonged thrombocytopenia associated with bone marrow transplantation still leads to catastrophic cerebral hemorrhage. Although the period of neutropenia following bone marrow transplantation has been reduced by the use of growth factors, and the routine use of potent prophylactic antibiotic and antiviral agents has reduced the incidence of infection, unusual or resistant central nervous system (CNS) infections continues to arise, often creating difficult treatment choices. Furthermore, the more effective classes of immunosuppressants may have direct toxic effects on the nervous system.•The major challenge for the future is to develop agents and strategies for management that can effect selective tolerance to the donated organ without paralyzing the immune system’s ability to fight infection. Such agents must also have limited or no toxicity to the nervous and other organ systems. The observations by Starzl [1] on the existence of leukocyte chimerism years after transplantation suggest that understanding and building on this natural phenomenon may hold promise for solving major problems in the field of organ transplantation.</td>
